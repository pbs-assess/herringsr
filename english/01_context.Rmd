# Context

Pacific Herring abundance in British Columbia (BC) is assessed using
a statistical catch-age (SCA) model.
In 2017, the Pacific Herring stock assessment included
updates to the SCA model [@martell2011],
and a bridging analysis to support these changes [@cleary2018].
Also introduced in the 2017 assessment was
the estimation of stock productivity and current stock status
relative to the new limit reference point (LRP) of $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017],
where $\SB_0$ is estimated unfished spawning biomass.
The structure of the SCA model has not changed since 2017.
<!-- In 2020 an update was made to the forecasting model.
Historically the model has used the estimated terminal year recruits when projecting the model one year ahead.
The change was made to use average recruitment generated from a normal distribution. -->

In 2016, DFO committed to renewing the current management framework to
address a range of challenges facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in BC.
Renewal of the management framework includes engaging in
a management strategy evaluation (MSE) process to evaluate
the performance of candidate management procedures against
a range of hypotheses about future stock and fishery dynamics.
As part of the MSE process,
a CSAS regional peer review occurred in the summer of 2018,
where performance of Pacific Herring management procedures (MPs) were assessed
against conservation objectives for the
Strait of Georgia (SoG) and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI)
stock assessment regions [SARs, @dfo2019a].
Steps included operating model (OM) development,
fitting the OM to Pacific Herring stock and fishery monitoring data
(OM conditioning), and
closed-loop simulations of MP performance for alternative
future natural mortality scenarios.
In the spring of 2019,
the MSE process was initiated for the
Haida Gwaii (HG), Prince Rupert District (PRD), and Central Coast (CC)
SARs [@dfo2019c].
In the summer of 2020,
updates were made to the MSE simulations for the WCVI and SoG management areas,
and in the summer of 2021,
similar updates were made to the MSE simulations for the
PRD and CC management areas.
For all four stocks, updates include
conditioning the OM with more recent stock and fishery data and
evaluating the performance of additional candidate MPs for these management areas.

Since initiation of the Pacific Herring MSE process,
results have been included in the annual stock assessment as follows:

1. The 2018 stock assessment included updated MP recommendations
for SoG and WCVI SARs for 2019 [@dfo2019b].

1. The 2019 stock assessment included MP recommendations
for SoG and WCVI SARs as per 2018, and
updated MP recommendations for HG, PRD, and CC [@dfo2020a].

1. The 2020 stock assessment includes updated MP recommendations
for SoG and WCVI SARs, and
MP recommendations for HG, PRD, and CC as per 2019 [@dfo2020a].  

1. The 2021 stock assessment includes MP recommendations
for SoG and WCVI SARs as per 2020 [@dfo2021], and
updated MP recommendations for PRD and CC.
Management measures to support long-term recovery of HG herring
are being developed through the rebuilding plan process.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Pacific Fisheries Management Branch requested
that DFO Pacific Science Branch assess the status of
British Columbia (BC) Pacific Herring stocks in `r assess_yr` and
recommend harvest advice for `r assess_yr + 1`
as simulation-tested MPs to inform the development of the
`r assess_yr`/`r assess_yr + 1` Integrated Fisheries Management Plan,
where appropriate.
Estimated stock trajectories,
current status of stocks for `r assess_yr`,
management procedure options, and
harvest advice recommendations from those MPs for `r assess_yr + 1`
reflect methods of @cleary2018 and,
where applicable,
recommendations from the aforementioned 2018, 2019 and 2020 MSE analyses.
These recommendations are described in the Section '\nameref{sec:harv-opts}.'
