# Context\label{sec:context}

Pacific Herring (*Clupea pallasii*) abundance in British Columbia (BC) is
assessed using a statistical catch-age (SCA) model [@martell2011].
In 2017, the Pacific Herring stock assessment included
updates to the SCA model,
and a bridging analysis to support these changes [@cleary2018].
Also introduced in the 2017 assessment was
the estimation of stock productivity and current stock status
relative to the new limit reference point (LRP) of $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017],
where $\SB_0$ is estimated unfished spawning biomass.
The structure of the SCA model has not changed since 2017.

In 2016, DFO committed to renewing the current management framework to
address a range of challenges facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in BC.
Renewal of the management framework includes engaging in
a management strategy evaluation (MSE) process to evaluate
the performance of candidate management procedures against
a range of hypotheses about future stock and fishery dynamics.
As part of the MSE process,
a CSAS regional peer review occurred in 2018,
where performance of Pacific Herring management procedures (MPs) were assessed
against conservation objectives for the
Strait of Georgia (SoG) and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI)
stock assessment regions (SARs) [@dfo2019a].
Steps included operating model (OM) development [@benson2022],
fitting the OM to Pacific Herring stock and fishery monitoring data
(OM conditioning), and
closed-loop simulations of MP performance for alternative
future natural mortality scenarios.
In 2019, DFO initiated the MSE process for the
Haida Gwaii (HG), Prince Rupert District (PRD), and Central Coast (CC)
SARs [@dfo2019c].
Updates to MP evaluations were then conducted for SoG and WCVI SARs in 2020 
[@dfo2021b],
and for all SARs herein.

This assessment incorporates new science advice on
choice of upper stock reference (USR) points
for four Pacific Herring major SARs (PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI).
An analysis of options was completed in 2022 [@dfo2022] and
implementation of USRs will occur through the 
2022/23 Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP).
To support on-going consultations,
five USR options are presented for PRD, CC, SoG and WCVI
(Section "\nameref{sec:harv-opts}").
For these four stocks
we also update conditioning of the Herring OM [@benson2022]
by including stock and fishery data from 1951 to 2021.
These updates first appear in @dfo2022.
MP evaluations presented in the harvest option tables 
reflect the latest OM updates.

Since initiation of the Pacific Herring MSE process,
results have been included in the annual stock assessment as follows:

1. The 2018 stock assessment includes MP recommendations
for the SoG and WCVI SARs [@dfo2019a].

1. The 2019 stock assessment includes MP recommendations for the 
HG, PRD, and CC SARs [@dfo2020a] and implements the previous years' MP 
recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs. 

1. The 2020 stock assessment includes an update to MP recommendations
for the SoG and WCVI SARs [@dfo2021b] and implements the previous
years' MP recommendations for HG, PRD, and CC SARs.

1. The 2021 stock assessment includes an update to MP recommendations 
for the PRD and CC SARs [@dfo2021c] and implements the previous years
MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs.

MPs are not updated for HG because management measures to support 
long-term recovery of HG herring are being developed through the 
rebuilding plan process.

The 2022 stock assessment includes
MP recommendations for PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI,
derived by updating Herring OMs conditioning [@benson2022] using 
the latest historic stock and fishery data from 1951-2021.
USR options first presented in @dfo2022 are included to
support selection of stock-specific USRs
for implementation through the 2022/23 IFMP.
Management measures to support long-term recovery of HG herring,
including rebuilding objectives and USR,
are documented in the draft
HG herring rebuilding plan.\footnote{\label{fn:rebuild}

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Pacific Fisheries Management Branch requested
that DFO Pacific Science Branch assess the status of
British Columbia (BC) Pacific Herring stocks in `r assess_yr` and
recommend harvest advice for `r assess_yr + 1`
as simulation-tested MPs to inform the development of the
`r assess_yr`/`r assess_yr + 1` IFMP,
where appropriate.
Estimated stock trajectories,
current status of stocks for `r assess_yr`,
management procedure options, and
harvest advice recommendations from those MPs for `r assess_yr + 1`
reflect methods of @cleary2018 and @benson2022 and,
where applicable,
recommendations from the aforementioned 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 MSE analyses
(Section "\nameref{sec:harv-opts}").
