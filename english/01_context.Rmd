# Context

Pacific Herring abundance in British Columbia (BC) is assessed using a statistical catch-age (SCA) model.
In 2017, the Pacific Herring stock assessment included updates to the model [integrated statistical catch-age model; @martell2011],
and a bridging analysis to support these changes [@cleary2018].
Also introduced in the 2017 assessment was the estimation of stock productivity and current stock status relative to the new limit reference point (LRP) of $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017], where $\SB_0$ is estimated unfished spawning biomass.
The structure of the 2017 model was not changed for the 2018 and 2019 stock assessments.

In 2016, DFO committed to renewing the current management framework to address a range of challenges facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in BC.
Renewal of the management framework includes engaging in a management strategy evaluation (MSE) process to evaluate the performance of candidate management procedures against a range of hypotheses about future stock and fishery dynamics.
As part of the MSE process, a CSAS regional peer review occurred July 25 and 26, 2018, where performance of Pacific Herring management procedures (MPs) were assessed against conservation objectives for Strait of Georgia (SoG) and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI) stock assessment regions [@dfo2019a].
Steps included operating model (OM) development, fitting the OM to Pacific Herring stock and fishery monitoring data, and closed-loop simulations of MP performance for alternative future natural mortality scenarios.
The 2018 stock assessment included updated MP recommendations for SoG and WCVI stock assessment regions for 2019 [@dfo2019b].
In the spring of 2019, the MSE process was initiated for the northern stock regions.
This process included performance evaluation of MPs for Haida Gwaii (HG), Prince Rupert District (PRD), and Central Coast [CC; @dfo2019c].

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Pacific Fisheries Management Branch requested that DFO Pacific Science Branch assess the status of British Columbia (BC) Pacific Herring stocks in
`r assess_yr` and recommend harvest advice for `r assess_yr + 1` as simulation-tested MPs to inform the development of the `r assess_yr`/`r assess_yr + 1` Integrated Fisheries Management Plan, where appropriate.
Estimated stock trajectories, current status of stocks for `r assess_yr`, management procedure options and harvest advice recommendations from those MPs for `r assess_yr + 1` reflect methods of @cleary2018 and,
where applicable, recommendations from the aforementioned 2018 and 2019 MSE analyses.
These recommendations are described in the Section '\nameref{sec:harv-opts}.'
