Pacific Herring (*Clupea pallasii*) abundance in British Columbia (BC) is
assessed using a statistical catch-age (SCA) model [@martell2011].
In 2017, the Pacific Herring stock assessment included
updates to the SCA model,
a bridging analysis to support these changes [@cleary2018], and 
estimation of stock productivity and current stock status
relative to the new limit reference point (LRP) of $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017],
where $\SB_0$ is estimated unfished spawning biomass.
In 2022, upper stock reference (USR) point options were introduced for the major 
SARs, and in this assessment estimation of stock status relative to productive period 
USRs [@dfo2022a] are included.
The overall structure of the SCA model has not changed since 2017.

In 2016, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) committed to
renewing the current management framework to
address a range of challenges facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in BC.
Renewal of the management framework included engaging in
a management strategy evaluation (MSE) process to evaluate
the performance of candidate management procedures against
a range of hypotheses about future stock and fishery dynamics.
As part of the MSE process,
a Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS)
regional peer review occurred in 2018,
where performance of Pacific Herring management procedures (MPs) were assessed
against conservation objectives for the
Strait of Georgia (SoG) and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI)
stock assessment regions (SARs) [@dfo2019a].
Steps included operating model (OM) development [@benson2022],
fitting the OM to Pacific Herring stock and fishery monitoring data
(OM conditioning), and
closed-loop simulations of MP performance for alternative
future natural mortality scenarios.
In 2019, DFO initiated the MSE process for the
Haida Gwaii (HG), Prince Rupert District (PRD), and Central Coast (CC)
SARs [@dfo2019c].
Updates to MP evaluations were then conducted for
SoG and WCVI SARs in 2020 [@dfo2021b] and
for PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI in 2023 [@dfo2022a,@dfo2022b].

This assessment includes new science advice on
choice of upper stock reference (USR) points
for all five Pacific Herring major SARs.
An analysis of USR options for PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI was completed in 
2022 [@dfo2022a] and provisional USRs based on productive 
periods identified for each SAR was implemented in the 2022/23 Integrated 
Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP).

<!-- DELETE
To support on-going consultations,
five USR options are presented for PRD, CC, SoG and WCVI
(Section "\nameref{sec:harv-opts}").
For these four stocks
we also update conditioning of the herring OM [@benson2022]
by including stock and fishery data from `r major_start_yr` to 2021.
These updates first appear in @dfo2022a.
MP evaluations presented in the harvest option tables 
reflect the latest OM updates. -->

Since initiation of the Pacific Herring MSE process,
MP evaluations have been included in the annual stock assessment as follows:

1. The 2018 stock assessment includes
MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs [@dfo2019a].

1. The 2019 stock assessment includes
MP recommendations for the HG, PRD, and CC SARs [@dfo2020a], and
implements the previous years' MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs. 

1. The 2020 stock assessment includes
an update to MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs [@dfo2021b], and
implements the previous years' MP recommendations for HG, PRD, and CC SARs.

1. The 2021 stock assessment includes
an update to MP recommendations for the PRD and CC SARs [@dfo2021c], and
implements the previous years MP recommendations for the SoG and WCVI SARs.

1. The 2022 stock assessment includes
an update to MP recommendations for PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI SARs [@dfo2022b].

Note that MPs for HG are not updated through this process. 
Instead, management measures to support long-term recovery of HG herring 
are being developed through the HG rebuilding plan process.\footnote{\label{fn:rebuild}

This `r assess_yr` stock assessment includes
MP recommendations for PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI,
derived in 2022 by updating herring OM conditioning [@benson2022] using 
the latest historic stock and fishery data from `r major_start_yr` to 2021 [@dfo2022b].
There are no new MP evaluations for `r assess_yr` (all probability metrics reflect the
MP evaluations presented in 2022).

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Pacific Fisheries Management Branch requested
that DFO Pacific Science Branch assess the status of
British Columbia (BC) Pacific Herring stocks in `r assess_yr` and
recommend harvest advice for `r assess_yr + 1`
as simulation-tested MPs to inform the development of the
`r assess_yr`/`r assess_yr + 1` IFMP, where appropriate.
Estimated stock trajectories,
current status of stocks for `r assess_yr`,
management procedure options, and
harvest advice recommendations from those MPs for `r assess_yr + 1`
reflect methods of @cleary2018 and @benson2022 and,
where applicable,
recommendations from the aforementioned 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 MSE analyses
(Section "\nameref{sec:harv-opts}").
