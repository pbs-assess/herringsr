# Conclusions

The `r assess_yr` Science Response includes formal analyses of
stock trend information for the Pacific Herring major SARs
using the stock assessment framework reviewed in 2017 [@cleary2018]
with data updated to include `r assess_yr`.

DFO has committed to developing and implementing a rebuilding plan for
Haida Gwaii Pacific Herring.
Based on MP evaluations, the harvest recommendation for the HG SAR is 0&nbsp;t.

The MSE process identifies a range of MPs that meet the conservation objective
with at least 75% probability for the PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI SARs
for the DDM reference OM scenario [@dfo2019c; @dfo2021b].
Harvest options or MP calculations for `r assess_yr + 1` for these four SARs
is combined with MP evaluations (probabilities)
arising from the latest MSE update.
Tables also include MP performance and harvest options for the DIM robustness 
OM scenario (Tables \@ref(tab:decision-prd) to \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi)).

Science advice for the minor SARs is limited to
presentation of catch data, biological data, and spawn survey data 
(Section "\nameref{sec:app-minor}").
Similarly, science advice for the special area, Area 10 is limited to
presentation of catch data, biological data, and spawn survey data 
(Section "\nameref{sec:app-special}").
