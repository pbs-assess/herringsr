# Conclusions

The `r assess_yr` Science Response includes a formal analyses of stock trend information for the Pacific Herring major SARs
using the stock assessment framework reviewed in 2017 [@cleary2018] with data time series update to 2020.

In the first MSE cycle for HG, none of the MPs tested could meet the conservation objective with at least 75% probability [@dfo2019c],
thus harvest options are not provided for 2020.
DFO has committed to developing and implementing a rebuilding plan for Haida Gwaii Herring by the end of fiscal year 2020/21,
and supports commercial herring fishery closures for the HG major stock region until April 2021.

The MSE process identifies a range of MPs that meet the conservation objective with at least 75% probability for PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI management areas for the Reference OM scenario ([@dfo2019c], MSE SR, $In-prep.$).
As such, harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1` for these SARs are provided using MPs that meet the minimum conservation criteria under the Reference OM scenario, 
whereby tables also include MP performance under the DIM and conM Robustness OM scenarios (Tables \@ref(tab:decision-prd) to \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi)).

Science advice for the minor SARs is limited to presentation of catch data, biological data, and spawn survey data (\nameref{sec:app-minor}).
