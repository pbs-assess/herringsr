# Conclusions

The `r assess_yr` Science Response includes a formal analyses of stock trend information for the Pacific Herring major SARs
using the stock assessment framework reviewed in 2017 [@cleary2018] with the data time series updated to `r assess_yr`

In the first MSE cycle for HG, none of the MPs tested could meet the conservation objective with at least 75% probability [@dfo2019c],
thus harvest options are not provided for `r assess_yr + 1`.
DFO has committed to developing and implementing a rebuilding plan for Haida Gwaii Herring by the end of fiscal year 2020/21,
and supports commercial herring fishery closures for the HG major stock region until April 2021.

The MSE process identifies a range of MPs that meet the conservation objective with at least 75% probability for
PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI management areas for the Reference OM scenario (@dfo2019c; @dfo2021b).
As such, harvest options or MP calculations for `r assess_yr + 1` for these SARs are provided
using MPs that meet the minimum conservation criteria under the Reference OM scenario.
Tables also include MP performance under the DIM and conM Robustness OM scenarios
(Tables \@ref(tab:decision-prd) to \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi)).

Science advice for the minor SARs is limited to
presentation of catch data, biological data, and spawn survey data 
(see Section "\nameref{sec:app-minor}").
Similarly, science advice for the special area, Area 10 is limited to
presentation of catch data, biological data, and spawn survey data 
(see Section "\nameref{sec:app-special}").
