## Minor stock assessment regions\label{sec:app-minor}

DFO does not conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the
`r number_to_word(length(minor_regions_short))`
Pacific Herring minor SARs: `r commify(minor_regions_full_parens)`.
However, DFO does provide
landed commercial catch (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-catch)),
<!-- incidental mortality in finfish aquaculture activities -->
<!-- (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-incidental)), -->
biological data including weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-wa)) and
proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-pa)),
as well as spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-spawn-index))
from `r minor_start_yr_plot` to `r minor_end_yr`.
DFO also provides the spawn index and proportion of spawn index by Section 
from `r minor_end_yr-num_yrs_tab` to `r minor_end_yr` for A27 and A2W
(Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a27) and \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a2w),
respectively).
For Area 27, spawn index by Section
from `r minor_start_yr_plot` to `r minor_end_yr` is also provided
(Figure \@ref(fig:spawn-section-a27)).

## Special areas\label{sec:app-special}

As is the case for the minor SARs,
DFO does not conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the
Pacific Herring special area, Area 10 (A10; Figure \@ref(fig:a10-map)).
However, DFO provides
biological data including weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:special-wa)) and
proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:special-pa)),
as well as spawn index and proportion of spawn index by Section
(Figure \@ref(fig:special-spawn-index),Table \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a10))
from `r special_start_yr_plot` to `r special_end_yr`, where available.
<!-- NOTE: DFO did not received 2023 spawn data collected by the -->
<!-- Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw Nation prior to publication. -->
Note that Area 10 is a subset of the Central Coast
and is outside the SAR boundary.
In addition, note that there is no landed commercial catch or
incidental mortality in finfish aquaculture activities
in Area 10 from `r special_start_yr_plot` to `r special_end_yr`.
