## Minor stock assessment regions\label{sec:app-minor}

We do not conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the
`r number_to_word(length(minor_regions_short))`
Pacific Herring minor SARs: `r commify(minor_regions_full_parens)`.
However, we provide the spawn index and proportion of spawn index by Section 
from `r minor_end_yr-num_yrs_tab` to `r minor_end_yr` for A27 and A2W
(Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a27) and \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a2w), respectively).
We also provide time series of
landed commercial catch (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-catch)),
biological data including weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-wa)) and
proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-pa)),
as well as spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-spawn-index-fig))
from `r minor_start_yr_plot` to `r minor_end_yr`.

## Special areas\label{sec:app-special}

We do not conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the
Pacific Herring special area, Area 10 (A10).
Note that special areas are not SARs;
therefore they are excluded from regular monitoring and analyses.
In addition, note that Area 10 is a subset of the Central Coast Sections that
are outside the official Central Coast SAR boundary (Sections 101, 102, and 103).
As with the minor SARs,
we provide the spawn index from `r minor_end_yr-num_yrs_tab` to `r minor_end_yr`
(Table \@ref(tab:special-spawn-index-tab)).
We also provide time series of
landed commercial catch (Figure \@ref(fig:special-catch)),
biological data including weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:special-wa)) and proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:special-pa)),
as well as the spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:special-spawn-index-fig))
from `r minor_start_yr_plot` to `r minor_end_yr`.
