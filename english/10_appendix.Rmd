## Minor stock assessment regions\label{sec:app-minor}

We do not conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the
`r number_to_word(length(minor_regions_short))`
Pacific Herring minor SARs: `r commify(minor_regions_full_parens)`.
However, we provide the spawn index and proportion of spawn index by Section 
from `r minor_end_yr-num_yrs_tab` to `r minor_end_yr` for A27 and A2W
(Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a27) and \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a2w), respectively).
For Area 27, we provide the spawn index by Section
from `r minor_start_yr_plot` to `r minor_end_yr`
(Figure \@ref(fig:spawn-section-a27)).
We also provide
landed commercial catch (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-catch)),
incidental catch (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-incidental)),
biological data including weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-wa)) and
proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-pa)),
as well as spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-spawn-index))
from `r minor_start_yr_plot` to `r minor_end_yr`.

## Special areas\label{sec:app-special}

We do not conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the
Pacific Herring special area, Area 10 (A10; Figure \@ref(fig:a10-map)).
Note that Area 10 is a subset of the Central Coast
and is outside the SAR boundary.
As with the minor SARs,
we provide the spawn index and proportion of spawn index by Section
from `r special_end_yr-num_yrs_tab` to `r special_end_yr`
(Table \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a10)).
<!-- TODO: Not sure what we want to say here -->
Note that 2022 spawn data may be incomplete;
DFO has not received data collected by the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw Nation.
We also provide
biological data including weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:special-wa)) and
proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:special-pa)),
as well as spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:special-spawn-index))
from `r special_start_yr_plot` to `r special_end_yr`.
Note that there is no commercial catch or incidental catch in Area 10 from 
`r special_start_yr_plot` to `r special_end_yr`.
