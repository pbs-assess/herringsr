## Minor stock assessment regions\label{sec:app-minor}

We do not conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the
`r number_to_word(length(minor_regions_short))`
Pacific Herring minor SARs: `r commify(minor_regions_full_parens)`.
However, we provide
landed commercial catch (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-catch)),
incidental mortality in finfish aquaculture activities
(Figure \@ref(fig:minor-incidental)),
biological data including weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-wa)) and
proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-pa)),
as well as spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:minor-spawn-index))
from `r minor_start_yr_plot` to `r minor_end_yr`.
We also provide the spawn index and proportion of spawn index by Section 
from `r minor_end_yr-num_yrs_tab` to `r minor_end_yr` for A27 and A2W
(Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a27) and \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a2w), respectively).
For Area 27, we provide the spawn index by Section
from `r minor_start_yr_plot` to `r minor_end_yr`
(Figure \@ref(fig:spawn-section-a27)).


## Special areas\label{sec:app-special}

As with the minor SARs,
we do not conduct formal analyses of stock trend information for the
Pacific Herring special area, Area 10 (A10; Figure \@ref(fig:a10-map)).
However, we provide
biological data including weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:special-wa)) and
proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:special-pa)),
as well as spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:special-spawn-index))
from `r special_start_yr_plot` to `r special_end_yr`.
We also provide the spawn index and proportion of spawn index by Section
from `r special_end_yr-num_yrs_tab` to `r special_end_yr`
(Table \@ref(tab:spawn-index-a10)).
<!-- TODO: Note that 2023 spawn data may be incomplete; -->
<!-- DFO has not received data collected by the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw Nation. -->
Note that Area 10 is a subset of the Central Coast
and is outside the SAR boundary.
In addition, note that there is no landed commercial catch or
incidental mortality in finfish aquaculture activities
in Area 10 from `r special_start_yr_plot` to `r special_end_yr`.
