# COVID-19 pandemic
<!-- COPIED FROM DATA SUMMARIES; NEEDS UPDATING -->

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our ability to collect and analyse Pacific Herring data throughout British Columbia in 2020. 
The pandemic and associated provincial response changed rapidly during the Pacific Herring field program season. 
Despite these challenges, surveyors assessed all major observed spawns in the five major stock assessment regions (SARs). 
The pandemic impacted our ability to assess herring spawn in SARs with later spawns more than SARs with earlier spawns. 
For example, spawns were surveyed by surface surveys instead of underwater dive surveys in Prince Rupert District and Haida Gwaii.

Although Pacific Herring biological samples were collected as usual, the pandemic delayed the analysis and availability of biological data for all SARs. 
Closure of the DFO sclerochronology lab at the Pacific Biological Station from March 16th through July 6th resulted in delayed availability of ages for Pacific 
Herring samples collected in 2020.
That said, throughout the summer the sclerochronology lab was able to process the full collection of 2020 samples to support the herring assessment program.

Additional impacts of the pandemic include:
delayed timing in availability of completed data summaries,
availability of Science staff in spring and summer months for area-specific discussions on herring data, and
timing of delivery of stock assessment advice.
