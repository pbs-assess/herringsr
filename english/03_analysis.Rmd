# Analysis and response

## COVID-19 pandemic

Compared to 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had fewer impacts
to Pacific Herring data collection and analysis in 2021.
Spawn surveys proceeded as usual in most areas in 2021,
with dive surveys in all major areas except Haida Gwaii.
Haida Gwaii would normally have a dive survey,
but had surface surveys in 2021 due to COVID-19.
The collection and analysis of biological data was not affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021

## Management strategy evaluation

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has committed to renewing the current management framework to
address a range of challenges facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in British Columbia. 
Renewal of the management framework for Pacific Herring uses MSE to evaluate the performance 
of candidate MPs against hypotheses about past and future stock and fishery dynamics. 
The purpose of the MSE process is to identify MPs that provide acceptable outcomes related to conservation and fishery management objectives. 
The identification of a preferred management procedure requires a fully specified set of measurable objectives that 
include reference points (typically categorized as limits and targets) and to the extent possible, 
specification of objectives related to catch, catch variability, and socio-cultural goals. 
MSE is an iterative and ongoing process conducted with the participation of
First Nations, the fishing industry, as well as government and non-government organizations.  

The first MSE cycles for the SoG and WCVI management areas were completed in 2018 [@dfo2019a].
Steps included OM development, fitting the OMs to Pacific Herring stock and fishery monitoring data from 1951 to 2017, 
and closed-loop simulations of MP performance for alternative future natural mortality scenarios [@dfo2019a].
In the spring of 2019, the MSE process was extended to the HG, PRD, and CC management areas
with stock and fishery monitoring data updated to include 2018
and performance evaluation of area specific MPs [@dfo2019c].
In the summer of 2020 the second MSE cycle was initiated for the WCVI and SoG management areas.
This included conditioning the OMs with more recent stock and fishery data,
and evaluating the performance of additional candidate MPs for these management areas.  

A core set of fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c] have been applied to each major SAR:

1. Maintain spawning biomass above the LRP with at least 75% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t > 0.3\SB_0) \geq 0.75$),

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., achieve a target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.6\SB_0) \geq 0.5$),

1. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25% over three Pacific Herring generations
(goal reflecting catch variability; $\text{AAV} < 0.25$), and

1. Maximize average annual catch over three Pacific Herring generations
(goal reflecting catch biomass).

However, a fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed for each management area.
DFO will continue to collaborate with coastal First Nations to develop area-specific objectives specific to Food, Social and Ceremonial fisheries as well as spawn-on-kelp (SOK) fisheries.
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with the herring industry, government, and non-government organizations
to describe broader objectives related to conservation, economics, and access.

The MPs for each SAR differ in the form of the HCR and choices of catch cap,
but use the same type of monitoring data and assessment model [e.g., @cleary2018].
The current stock assessment model assumes natural mortality is time-varying and this
is reflected in the MSE as three hypotheses about future Pacific Herring natural mortality $M$: 

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-dependent process (DDM),

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-independent process (DIM), and

1. $M$ is constant over time (conM).

These three hypotheses are captured as three operating model (OM) scenarios in @dfo2019a.
The DDM scenario was identified as the Reference OM scenario based on discussion at the July 2018 CSAS review process [@dfo2019c],
while the DIM and conM scenarios were identified as Robustness OM scenarios.
There is however currently no scientifically supported method for predicting the natural mortality and thus all three scenarios are included. 

Several lessons were learned from the MSE analyses conducted so far:

1. The catch-at-age stock assessment model can produce large (positive) assessment errors.
Such assessment errors cause over-estimation of spawning biomass and
result in recommended catch limits such that the realized harvest rate exceeds the intended target specified by a HCR (e.g., over-harvest).

1. Reduction in harvest rate from 20% to 10% was the most effective means of mitigating 
stock assessment errors by reducing the absolute size of the catch.
The use of a catch cap, implemented as a maximum annual catch level, 
was an effective model-free way to further mitigate assessment errors at very high biomass levels.
Simulation analyses additionally showed that outcomes are insensitive to the choice of
operational control points (OCPs) in the HCR when a low harvest rate (HR) and catch cap are applied.
This occurs because low biomass levels (associated with the lower OCP) are avoided for these MPs.

1. Differences in specification of Pacific Herring MPs, including the HCR components, are expected a priori among SARs.
The reasons relate to differences in objectives deemed important by resource users,
differences in historical and current stock and fishery dynamics, and
differences in the magnitude and direction of assessment model errors in each SAR.
Conservation objectives such as those based on avoiding a threshold to serious harm (i.e., a limit reference point) 
in alignment with the DFO PA Framework [@dfo2009] are held constant among SARs based on the analyses of @kronlund2017.

1. There are many possible ways to incorporate MP performance in robustness trials into decision-making but, 
there is currently no accepted scientific way of combining results from multiple operating models.

1. In situations where multiple MPs meet the agreed upon objectives, further criteria, such as ranking secondary objectives, is 
needed in order to provide decision-makers with a tractable set of trade-off choices.

1. Outcomes of MP evaluations appear to be influenced by the last three to five years of stock status and 
natural mortality trends used to condition the  OM. 
If simulations were run over a greater number of years (i.e., 50 years) performance would start to approach equilibrium and be 
unaffected by most recent trends in OM conditioning data.

## Input data

There are three types of input data used for the Pacific Herring stock assessment: catch data, biological data, and abundance data.
These data sets are described in the following sections, and summarized in Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Relative to the previous assessment, the only change made to input data was to update all data time series to include data from the `r this_season` herring season (July 1 to June 30).
Note that we refer to 'year' instead of 'herring season' in this report;
therefore `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season` Pacific Herring season.

### Catch data

For the purposes of stock assessment, catch data are summarized by gear type as described in Table \@ref(tab:data-input) and presented in Figure \@ref(fig:major-catch).
As in previous years, catch input to the stock assessment model does not include mortality from the commercial SOK fishery, nor any recreational fisheries or food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) harvest.
The FSC and recreational harvest are considered minor relative to commercial harvest.
The commercial SOK fishery is licensed based on pounds of validated SOK product (i.e., eggs adhered to kelp), not tonnes of fish used or spawned.
Currently there is no basis for validating mortality imposed on the population by this fishery, however methods for estimating SOK mortality are being developed.

Combined commercial removals from `r assess_yr-9` to `r assess_yr` from the roe, food and bait, and special use fisheries appear in Table \@ref(tab:annual-catch).
The proportion of coast-wide catch that comes from the SoG was 22% in 1990, and 100% in `r assess_yr`.
Total SOK harvest (pounds of validated product) for the major SARs from `r assess_yr-9` to `r assess_yr` is presented in Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch).

<!-- TODO: Placeholder.. needs work -->
\textbf{Incidental catch}

Some fisheries and aquaculture activities in BC cause
incidental mortality to Pacific Herring;
we call this incidental catch.
Similar to SOK harvest as well as FSC and recreational catch,
incidental catch is not accounted for in the Pacific Herring stock assessment, 
and is considered minor relative to commercial harvest.
Although incidental catch is not included in Pacific Herring stock assessments,
we provide estimated incidental catch in aquaculture activities by SAR from
`r min(ic_yrs)` to `r max(ic_yrs)` (Figure \@ref(fig:major-incidental)).
<!-- This seems trivial to me, but this is distinguished in the data: -->
<!-- Incidental catch includes fish caught during aquaculture activities, and -->
<!-- fish observed when recovering farmed fish carcasses. -->

1. Data is provided by Pacific Fishery Management Area (PFMA) and year.
    a. PFMAs are analogous to Statistical Areas, but PFMAs are larger.
    a. Incomplete catch data for 2020.
1. Data indicate the number of Pacific Herring released and dead.
    a. Unknown mortality rate for "released" fish.
    a. Unknown length, weight, age, and sex of fish.
    a. "Herring-like" fish are assumed to be herring when decomposition hinders identification.

Possible discussion points:

1. How incidental catch affects herring stocks.
1. How ignoring incidental catch affects stock assessments.
1. Mention possible incidental catch in other fisheries such as groundfish trawl.

### Biological data\label{sec:biol-data}

Biological samples are collected as described in @cleary2018 and Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Biological data inputs to the stock assessment are annual weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-wa)) and 
annual numbers-at-age, shown as proportions-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-pa)).

Significant declines in weight-at-age are evident for all major herring stocks, from the mid-1980s to 2010.
Declining weight-at-age may be attributed to any number of factors, including
fishing effects (i.e., gear selectivity),
environmental effects (e.g., changes in ocean productivity), or
changes in sampling protocols (e.g., shorter time frame over which samples are collected).
There has been an increasing trend in weight-at-age for all major stocks from 2012 to `r assess_yr`, although to a lesser degree for PRD.

### Abundance data

The spawn index survey collects information on spawn length (parallel to shore), spawn width (perpendicular to shore), number of egg layers by vegetation type, and other data.
There are two spawn survey periods defined by the predominant survey method:
surface period from `r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`, and
dive period from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`.
Data from these surveys are used to calculate egg densities per spawn.
Ultimately, the estimated weight of mature spawners required to produce the egg deposition is calculated and referred to as the 'spawn index'.
Execution of the `r surv_yr_rng[2]` spawn survey followed standard dive survey protocols for SoG, CC, and WCVI SARs as described in @cleary2018, and
a surface survey protocol was used for HG and PRD SARs due to COVID-19.
Time series of spawn index by major stock assessment region, from `r paste(surv_yr_rng, collapse=" to ")` are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index).
In `r surv_yr_rng[2]`, there was a notable increase in survey biomass (index values) for HG and SoG SARs (Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index) and Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) & \@ref(tab:spawn-index-sog)),
a small increase in survey biomass for WCVI (Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index) and Table \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi)), and
a small decrease in survey biomass for PRD and CC (Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index) and Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-prd) & \@ref(tab:spawn-index-cc)).

## Spatial spawn distribution

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) through \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) summarize the spatial distribution of survey spawn biomass (i.e., the spawn index)
by proportion over the most recent `r num_yrs_tab+1` years for the major SARs.
HG and SoG are summarized by Group, while PRD, CC, and WCVI are summarized by Statistical Area;
the choice of spatial grouping reflects spawning behaviour and biology for each SAR based on the survey data and working group discussions with local First Nations.

## First Nations observations

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact First Nations participation in herring survey activities as well as participation in traditional harvest activities (FSC). 
Assembling local observations was not possible for the 2020 season, however in 2021, local observations were provided by coastal First Nations participants for most areas.

### Haida Gwaii

\textbf{Selwyn and Cumshewa Inlets}

This stock has seen steady declines over the past decade to the point where this past season there almost was no spawn to be found. 
The spawn occurred very late in the season (late April) and was in outer Selwyn near Rockfish Harbour (rather than inside Selwyn near Traynor Bay). 
The spawn this year was considered to be fairly minimal for Selwyn Inlet standards and insufficient to extend into Cumshewa Inlet.

\textbf{Skincuttle and Upper Burnaby}

This year the bulk of the spawning occurred on the Skincuttle side, but in other years it has occurred more north of the narrows in upper Burnaby Strait. This stock is just barely maintaining itself. Abundance is low enough that natural recruitment just barely makes up for natural mortality – so we see some years of slight recovery followed by other years of decline, but no real growth even in the absence of a fishery now in almost 20 years.

\textbf{Juan Perez Sound}

These inlets normally will support spawns when there are a lot of recruitment in the population and first time spawners can out number old repeat spawners. That has not been the case now for some time. Lately spawns have been small and infrequent in the inlets of Juan Perez Sound, as was the case in 2021.

\textbf{Louscoone Inlet}

There has not been a significant presence of herring abundance in outer Louscoone for a number of years now. In years of abundance, the local stock was always found to be well up inside the inlet and often presented a very light spawn near the head in the early portion of the season (early to mid March). This stock seldom exceeded 500 ton – however in recent years it has been much less. The other stock appears to be more migratory- found in the outer portions of Louscoone Inlet and rarely spawns in Louscoone. One theory is outer Louscoone is used as a staging area and that these herring would then migrate elsewhere (possibly to the in the Central Coast) to spawn. Now, abundance is not high enough to allow herring to build up in outer Louscoone early in the season – so we only see evidence of the minor local stock.

\textbf{Traditional harvest}

There was some effort for the traditional harvest of k’aaw in both Skincuttle Inlet and Selwyn Inlet in early to mid April, 2021. 
The open kelp lines set up in Jedway Bay, Skincuttle Inlet, were successful with approximately 2,000 lbs of good quality k’aaw being harvested. 
The open kelp lines set up in the cove just south of Traynor Bay, Selwyn Inlet, were unsuccessful due to the absence of spawn. 
There were no other (known) attempts for the harvest of k’aaw on Haida Gwaii during the 2021 herring season.

### Prince Rupert District

Observations from the Lax Kw’alaams Band:
Overall, very little spawn was observed this season by members and staff.
Lax Kw’alaams Fisheries Technicians,
in coordination with Metlakatla Guardians,
spent ten full days during the herring season
monitoring harvest and recording herring behaviour and locations.
During the surveys,
technicians were unable to locate herring schools in
any of the normal geographic areas monitored each year.
This year in the Prince Rupert District,
Lax Kw’alaams had several fishermen out on the water.
On-grounds correspondence with harvesters confirmed that herring spawn in the 
2021 season was quite poor and ephemeral, and
most reported seeing no active herring spawning in important harvest areas.
However, the FSC harvest incidentally reported spawn in a couple of areas and
was more promising than previous years.
A few more community members were able to obtain some spawn-on-branches
for the first time in many years,
with sufficient layers to justify a small harvest.
However, Lax Kw’alaams fishermen were unable to gather enough herring
to satisfy FSC needs for the majority of the community.

### Central Coast

### Strait of Georgia

\textbf{Northern SoG}

A-Tlegay Fisheries assisted the herring assessment program by providing additional dive survey coverage and attempting to collect cast net samples on active spawns. 
A-Tlegay divers surveyed spawn from Willow Point south down to Bates Beach (and beyond), Herring Sections 135 and 141.
Through an outreach program, spawns were also reported to A-Tlegay from local mainland inlet areas.
As a result, A-Tlegay was able to dive on 2 spawns in Bute Inlet and 1 spawn in Teakerne Arm (Section 151).

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

In general, herring spawn was sporadic and short in duration
in Barkley and Nootka Sounds
with a spawn lasting several days in Hesquiaht Harbour.  

In Nootka, herring were in the deep off of Yuquot for a couple of weeks
and then they moved outside to Bajo Reef/Beano Creek area in mid-March.
Bird and marine mammal activity shifted from the vicinity of
Yuquot out to Bajo/Beano area.
Ray Williams of Yuquot reported a small spawn in the lower end of Tahsis Inlet,
but it could not be located by the spawn reconnaissance crew.
There was a small harvest of spawn on kelp (60 lbs. total)
just off the rocks of Escalante. 

There was a small spawn in the shallows in the Port Langford area of Nuchatlitz
on March 9th and later in Rosa Harbour.
Only 20% of the trees set for spawn-on-bough collections were successful in the area.  

In Area 23, the spawns were small and short in duration around mid-March.
The main spawn was around Muscle Beach to Macoha on March 12.
Most trees set for spawn-on-boughs collections reported having mostly 2 to 4
layers of eggs and were set back in the water to hatch.

There were several trees for home use set by First Nations
at this active spawn during sample collections.
Activity was noted in front of the beach North and South of Maggie River
but they did not appear to be actively spawning.
Other spawn investigated around this time was at Mussel beach.
At the end of March a small spawn was reported at Lyall point. 

In Area 24, most spawning activity was in and around Hesquiaht Harbour
from about the first week in March until near the end of the month.
Hesquiaht Harbour is not a great area for SOB due to the prevalence
of sandy bottom  substrates and windy conditions.  

## Stock status update

Analyses of stock trend information for AM2 are presented following methods of @cleary2018 for the Pacific Herring major stock assessment regions.
Perceptions of stock status based on outputs from the SCA model (AM2) are summarized for each stock in a multi-panel figure (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)).
The panels show:

a. Time series of model fit to scaled spawn survey data,\label{item:storyIndex}

a. Time series of instantaneous natural mortality rate $M$ estimates,

a. Time series reconstruction of number of age-`r age_first` recruits,

a. Time series of estimated spawning biomass $\SB_t$ and total catch $C_t$ in year $t$,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$,

a. Time series of (log) deviations from the estimated Beverton-Holt recruitment function, and

a. Phase plot of spawning biomass production ($\frac{\SB_{t+1} - \SB_t + C_{t+1}}{\SB_t}$) for the dive survey period,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$.\label{item:storyPhase}

Note that spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index) is scaled to abundance in panel (a) by the spawn survey scaling parameter $q$.
The spawn index has two distinct periods defined by the dominant survey method: 
surface surveys (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`), and 
dive surveys (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`).
Thus, two $q$ parameters are implemented in the estimation procedure:
$q_1$ (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`) with an uninformative prior, and
$q_2$ (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`) with an informative prior approximating 1.0.

The surface survey methodology has been used on occasion from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`. 
Generally this occurs in instances when herring spawn is observed in locations where a dive survey team is not available, or
when spawning occurs very early (January or February) or late (May) in the season. 
In these instances, spawner biomass estimates obtained from surface surveys for a given stock area and year are added to
biomass estimates from dive surveys, and $q_2 = 1$ is assumed for the combined index.
In 2020 and `r surv_yr_rng[2]`, a full surface survey was conducted for the HG SAR and
in this assessment the resulting survey biomass estimates are assumed continuous with the dive survey time series.

### Reference points\label{sec:ref-pts}

A biological limit reference point (LRP) is defined for the major Pacific Herring SARs at $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017].
Candidate upper stock references (USR) were introduced in @cleary2018 and implemented as biomass objectives in the simulation analyses for WCVI and SoG in 2018 [@dfo2019a] and then for HG, PRD, and CC in 2019 [@dfo2019c].
Candidate USRs are:

1. $0.4\SB_0$,

1. $0.6\SB_0$,

1. Average spawning biomass from `r major_start_yr` to `r assess_yr`, $\SB_{\mli{ave}}$, and

1. Average spawning biomass during a productive period [@cleary2018], $\SB_{\mli{ave-prod}}$.

Simulation results showed similar properties between USRs $0.6\SB_0$ and $\SB_{\mli{ave}}$ both within and among SARs,
while the USR based on the average biomass in a productive period, $\SB_{\mli{ave-prod}}$, was found to be most variable among SARs.
The simulation-evaluations did not select a single USR,
however a USR of $0.6\SB_0$ is included in this stock status update because this candidate is sufficiently above the LRP (2*LRP) and it is a repeatable calculation across all SARs.
Stock status relative to the assessment model estimates $0.3\SB_0$ (LRP) and $0.6\SB_0$ (one candidate USR) are presented for each SAR in Tables \@ref(tab:ref-points-hg) through \@ref(tab:ref-points-wcvi).

The LRP and USR relate stock status to the DFO PA Framework [@dfo2009], and in the assessment of Pacific Herring the same calculations are applied for each SAR.
There is an important distinction between reference points (e.g., LRP, USR) and
the operational control points of the harvest control rule (HCR) or the management procedure used to set catch limits.
Specifically, operational control points (OCPs) define the inflection points of a HCR, and identify biomass levels where management action is taken.
For example, the harvest rate is set to zero and fishing ceases when biomass falls below the lower OCP.


### Central Coast

Estimated spawning biomass demonstrates a strongly declining trend from a historic high around 1980
before reaching historic low levels in the period of 2005-2015 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)d).
An increase in spawning stock biomass was estimated through the mid-2010s
but remained below levels estimated prior to 2000, with survey biomass declining in 2017, 2018 and 2021.
In 2019 there was an increase in estimated spawning biomass, with a similar level estimated for 2020.
The estimated biomass trend largely reflects the trend in the spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a),
where fluctuations correspond opposite to the fluctuations in estimated natural mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)b).
For example, the decline in spawn index (and estimated spawning biomass) to the historic lows of the late 2000s followed a strongly increasing trend in estimated natural mortality through the same period.
Estimated natural mortality moderated by the late 2000s, which was followed by the increase in spawn index (and estimated spawning biomass) until 2017 whereupon natural mortality ceased declining.
Recruitment deviations were slightly negative (lower than predicted by the stock-recruitment function) on average from about 1990 to 2017,
and are above average in 2019 and 2020 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)e).
The model estimates very similar spawning biomass from 2019 through 2021 (Table \@ref(tab:cc-spawning-biomass-depletion)), and the analysis of surplus production shows there is evidence of strong production in the year between 2016-2017 and between 2018-2019,
similar to the 1990 to 1999 period (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)f).
However, surplus production in the year between 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 is estimated to be negative.

An examination of spawn biomass by Herring Section shows the recent decline in herring spawn to have largely occurred in
Spiller Channel (Sections 072 and 078) and Kitasu Bay (Section 067).
The majority of spawn in 2021 occurred in Thompson/Stryker (Section 074).
Occurrance of spawn in Thompson/Stryker in 2020 and 2021 represents the first significant spawns for this section in many years (Figure \@ref(fig:spawn-section-cc)).

A fixed cutoff HCR was implemented in 1986, and from 1986 to 2007 the effective harvest rate $U_t$ is estimated to fluctuate above and below the `r target_hr*100`% target rate,
with median estimates exceeding `r target_hr*100`% frequently (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
Occurrences of $U_t$ exceeding the `r target_hr*100`% target harvest rate are due in part to
positive assessment model errors, and
lags in detecting a directional change in the trend.

Following a commercial fishery closure from 2007 to 2013, the CC stock reopened to commercial fisheries in 2014,
and small commercial roe fisheries occurred in 2014, 2015, and 2016.
A commercial SOK fishery operated yearly from 2014 to 2020,
however these removals are not included in the estimation of $U_t$. 
Commercial SOK fishery did not occur in Area 07 in 2020 due to COVID-19, however did successfully resume in 2021 (Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch)).

The model estimates spawning biomass in `r assess_yr`, `r paste0("$\\SB_{", assess_yr, "}$")`, at `r f(cc_final_yr_sbt[2])`&nbsp;t (posterior median),
equal to `r f(cc_final_yr_dt[2]*100, 1)`% of $\SB_0$
(Tables \@ref(tab:cc-spawning-biomass-depletion) & \@ref(tab:ref-points-cc)).
Spawning biomass in `r assess_yr` is estimated to be greater than the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$ with a `r f((1 - cc_prob_less_03sbo) * 100, 1)`% probability (Table \@ref(tab:ref-points-cc)).

## Management performance

Management procedure performance can be investigated using time series of effective harvest rate.
The estimated effective harvest rate $U$ in each year $t$, calculated as
$U_t = C_t/(C_t + \SB_t)$, where
$C_t$ is catch in year $t$, and
$\SB_t$ is estimated spawning biomass in year $t$.
Times series of $U_t$ relative to target harvest rate of `r target_hr*100`% are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate).

## Application of MPs and harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`\label{sec:harv-opts}

<!--Generally, harvest advice for the major stocks of Pacific Herring has been based on a 1-year forecast of pre-fishery spawning biomass and
application of a HCR that is a hybrid of fixed escapement and a target harvest rate (e.g., @hall1988).
Although the target harvest rate has varied among regions in recent years (e.g., CC and PRD SARs; @dfo2017),
the “historical” practice was to apply a target harvest rate of `r target_hr*100`%
when the forecast is estimated to be above a fixed commercial fishery cutoff of
$0.25\SB_0$ defined in the 1996 stock assessment [@dfo2016].
This rule is referred to as the "fixed cutoff rule."

Renewal of the Pacific Herring management framework included a commitment to MSE simulation-evaluation of the performance of historical fixed cutoff and
alternative MPs in relation to conservation and fisheries management objectives.
The first cycle of the MSE process was completed for the WCVI and SoG SARs in 2018 [@dfo2019a];
a similar process was used to evaluate harvest strategies for HG, PRD, and CC in 2019 [@dfo2019c].
In the summer of 2020 the second MSE cycle was initiated 
for the WCVI and SoG management areas.
In this cycle updates included conditioning the OMs with more recent stock
and fishery data and evaluating the performance of additional candidate MPs for these management areas. 

The ranking of objectives and selection of MPs that meet objectives using MSE is an iterative process.
The first cycle of Pacific Herring MSE includes, as a starting point, four core fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c] which reflect DFO policy, and were applied to each major SAR:

1. Maintain spawning biomass above the LRP with at least 75% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t > 0.3\SB_0) \geq 0.75$),

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., achieve a target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.6\SB_0) \geq 0.5$),

1. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25% over three Pacific Herring generations
(goal reflecting catch variability; $\text{AAV} < 0.25$), and

1. Maximize average annual catch over three Pacific Herring generations
(goal reflecting catch biomass).

However, a fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed for each management area.
DFO will continue to collaborate with coastal First Nations to develop area-specific objectives specific to Food, Social and Ceremonial fisheries as well as spawn-on-kelp (SOK) fisheries.
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with the herring industry, government, and non-government organizations
to describe broader objectives related to conservation, economics, and access.

The MPs for each SAR differ in the form of the HCR and choices of catch cap, but use the same monitoring data and assessment model [e.g., @cleary2018].
The current assessment model assumes natural mortality is time-varying.
The first MSE cycle introduced three hypotheses about future Pacific Herring natural mortality $M$: 

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-dependent process (DDM),

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-independent process (DIM), and

1. $M$ is constant over time (conM).

These three hypotheses are captured as three operating model (OM) scenarios in @dfo2019a.
The DDM scenario was identified as the Reference OM scenario based on discussion at the July 2018 CSAS review process [@dfo2019c],
while the DIM and conM scenarios were identified as Robustness OM scenarios.
There is however currently no scientifically supported method for predicting the natural mortality and therefore all three scenarios are included. 

Results presented here represent all three OM scenarios.

Several lessons were learned from the analysis:

1. The catch-at-age stock assessment model can produce large (positive) assessment errors.
Such assessment errors cause over-estimation of spawning biomass and
result in recommended catch limits such that the realized harvest rate exceeds the intended target specified by a HCR (e.g., over-harvest).

1. Reduction in harvest rate from 20% to 10% was the most effective means of mitigating stock assessment errors by reducing the absolute size of the catch.
The use of a catch cap, implemented as a maximum annual catch level, was an effective model-free way to further mitigate assessment errors at very high biomass levels.
Simulation analyses additionally showed that outcomes are insensitive to the choice of operational control points (OCPs) in the HCR when a low harvest rate (HR) and catch cap are applied.
This occurs because low biomass levels (associated with the lower OCP) are avoided for these management procedures (MPs).

1. Differences in specification of Pacific Herring MPs, including the HCR components, are expected a priori among SARs.
The reasons relate to differences in objectives deemed important by resource users,
differences in historical and current stock and fishery dynamics, and
differences in the magnitude and direction of assessment model errors in each SAR.
Conservation objectives such as those based on avoiding a threshold to serious harm (i.e., a limit reference point) in alignment with the DFO PA Framework [@dfo2009] are held constant among SARs based on the analyses of @kronlund2017.-->

Harvest options for `r assess_yr+1` reflect application of simulation-tested MPs for each major SAR. 
The description of MP evaluations for HG, PRD and CC appearing below reflects the 2019 assessment [@dfo2020a].
MPs included for SoG and WCVI combines information from the first MSE cycle [@dfo2020a] with updated MP evaluations conducted in September 2020
(DFO 2020c, *In prep.*\footnote{\label{fn:MSESR2020}DFO. 2020c. Updated evaluation of management procedures for Pacific Herring (\emph{Clupea pallasii}) in the Strait of Georgia and the West Coast of Vancouver Island management areas of British Columbia. DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Sci. Resp. In prep.}).
Finally, science advice in 2018 recommended discontinuing the use of the historical fixed cutoff HCR [@dfo2019a], as such this MP has been removed from further consideration for all Pacific Herring SARs.

### Central Coast

The CC stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from approximately 2005 to 2014.
An increasing trend has been observed in recent years, and overall the stock shows more volatility (large increases/ decreases in spawn abundance, Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a) than was observed prior to 2005.
For the CC, MPs performing best against the conservation objective have a 10% or lower harvest rate and include a range of operational control point choices.
Similar to PRD, the simulation results for CC indicate there are multiple MPs that meet the conservation objective of maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability (at least 75%)^\ref{fn:HighProb}^.
For management regions where multiple MPs meet the conservation objective, further ranking of the remaining objectives is needed in order to provide decision makers with a tractable set of trade-off choices.
However this was not undertaken with the first MSE cycle because a fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed for each management area.

In the absence of fishing, spawning biomass in `r assess_yr + 1` is forecast at `r f(cc_proj_sbt[2])`&nbsp;t (posterior median), almost the same as the median estimate of `r f(cc_final_yr_sbt[2])`&nbsp;t in `r assess_yr` (Table \@ref(tab:ref-points-cc)).
The `r assess_yr + 1` spawning biomass is forecast to be below the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$ with `r f(cc_prob_proj_less_03sbo * 100, 1)`% probability in the absence of fishing.

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs, are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc).
MP performance against conservation, biomass and yield objectives (e.g., reported probability values in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc)) has been updated to include data from 2019 and 2020.
That is, the MSE operating model conditioning was updated to include spawn, catch, and biological data for 2019 and 2020, and the MSE simulations were re-run to generate updated probability values for MPs presented in September 2019 [@dfo2020a] and 2020 [@dfo2021].

Harvest options listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc) reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1` forecast biomass for CC,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective with a minimum 75% probability under the Reference OM (DDM) scenario.
Harvest options under the two Robustness OM scenarios are also included.
For ease of comparison with MSE results [@dfo2019c], all MPs and scenarios listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc) include  performance metrics for the four core objectives.

Additionally, DFO acknowledges commitment to the Heiltsuk Nation for the development of a Joint Fisheries Management Plan for Pacific Herring in the Central Coast in `r assess_yr + 1`.
Results presented here may inform this on going commitment.
