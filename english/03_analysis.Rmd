# ANALYSIS AND RESPONSE

## Management strategy evaluation\label{sec:mse}

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has committed to
renewing the current management framework to address a range of challenges
facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in BC. 
Renewal of the management framework for Pacific Herring uses MSE to
evaluate the performance of candidate MPs against
hypotheses about past and future stock and fishery dynamics. 
The purpose of the MSE process is to
identify and eliminate MPs that incur unacceptable risks to a stock
and identify MPs that provide acceptable outcomes
related to conservation and fishery management objectives.
Identifying preferred MPs requires measurable objectives that include
reference points (typically categorized as limits and targets) and
those related to catch, catch variability, and socio-cultural goals. 
MSE is an iterative and ongoing process conducted with the participation of
First Nations, the fishing industry, as well as
government and non-government organizations. 

The first MSE cycles for the SoG and WCVI SARs
were completed in 2018 [@dfo2019a].
Steps included OM development [@benson2022],
fitting OMs and simulations of MP performance for
various hypothesized natural mortality scenarios [@dfo2019a].
In 2019, the MSE process was extended to HG, PRD, and CC SARs
and performance evaluation of SAR specific MPs [@dfo2019c],
with subsequent updates outlined in Section "\nameref{sec:context}".
Management procedure evaluation tables were updated in 2022
[@dfo2022b].

Currently, a core set of fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c]
have been drafted for each major SAR,
however only the conservation objective (1)
has been used in the selection of MPs:

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the LRP with at least 75% probability
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.3 \SB_0) \geq 0.75$),
where generation time is estimated to be about five years [@cleary2010].

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% probability 
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., achieve a target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq \SB_{targ}) \geq 0.50$).

1. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25%
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., minimize catch variability; $\text{AAV} < 0.25$).

1. Maximize average annual catch
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., maximize average catch).

A fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed for each SAR.
DFO will continue to collaborate with coastal First Nations to
develop area-specific objectives specific for FSC and SOK fisheries.
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with
the herring industry, government, and non-government organizations
to describe broader objectives related to conservation, economics, and access.

MPs for each SAR differ in the form of the harvest control rule (HCR)
and choice of catch cap,
but use the same type of monitoring data and assessment model
[e.g., @cleary2018].
The current stock assessment model
assumes natural mortality $M$ is time-varying and
this is reflected in the MSE as
two hypotheses about future Pacific Herring natural mortality: 

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-dependent process (DDM), and

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-independent process (DIM).

These two hypotheses are captured
as operating model (OM) scenarios in @benson2022.
The DDM scenario was identified as the reference OM scenario based on
discussion at the 2018 CSAS review process [@dfo2019c],
while the DIM scenario was identified as a robustness OM scenario.

On June 26 to 28, 2023, a regional peer review occurred for
"Application of a new modelling framework for the assessment of Pacific Herring 
(*Clupea pallasii*) major stocks and implementation in the MSE process."
The details of the review process are summarized in @dfo2023a, and
there were two key recommendations for implementation:

1. A process to
implement the new assessment and operating model, 
update the MSE, and
identify exceptional circumstances 
should be developed in a phased approach in consultation with managers, 
First Nations and other stakeholders.

1. A minimum three year cycle for MSE updates is recommended, 
unless new evidence reveals exceptional circumstances.

DFO has advanced these recommendations and
has implemented the spatially integrated statistical catch at age 
herring (SISCAH) modelling framework for
the SoG SAR beginning in 2024 [@dfo2025b] and
the PRD SAR beginning in 2025 (DFO. In prep.).$^{\ref{fn:dfo2025c}}$
For the remaining three SARs (HG, CC, and WCVI)
we implement MPs from the previously approved operating model (as per 2024).

## Input data

There are three types of input data used for
the Pacific Herring stock assessment:
catch data, biological data, and abundance data.
These data are described in the following sections, and
summarized in Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Relative to the previous assessment,
the only change to input data was to extend all the time series
to include the `r this_season` herring season (July 1 to June 30).
Note that we refer to 'year' instead of 'herring season' in this report;
therefore `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season` Pacific Herring season.

### Catch data

For the purposes of stock assessment,
catch data are summarized by gear type as described in
Table \@ref(tab:data-input) and presented in Figure \@ref(fig:major-catch).
As in previous years, catch data for the stock assessment model
does not include mortality from the commercial SOK fishery,
nor any recreational fisheries or food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) harvest.
Recreational fisheries and FSC harvest are considered minor
relative to commercial harvest.
The commercial SOK fishery is licensed based on pounds of validated SOK product
(i.e., eggs adhered to kelp), not tonnes of fish used or spawned.
Currently there is no basis to validate mortality
imposed on the population by this fishery, however
methods for estimating SOK mortality have been developed within
the SISCAH modelling framework [@dfo2023a].

Combined commercial removals from `r assess_yr - num_yrs_tab` to `r assess_yr`
from the roe, food and bait, and special use fisheries
appear in Table \@ref(tab:annual-catch).
Total SOK harvest (i.e., pounds of validated product) for the major SARs
from `r assess_yr - num_yrs_tab` to `r assess_yr` is presented in the
\link{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16898404}{Pacific Herring data summaries}.

### Biological data\label{sec:biol-data}

Biological samples are collected as described in
@cleary2018 and Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Biological data inputs to the stock assessment are
annual weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-wa)) and 
annual number-at-age, shown as proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-pa)).

Declines in weight-at-age are evident for all major SARs
from the mid-1980s to 2010.
Declining weight-at-age may be due to a number of factors, including
fishing effects (i.e., gear selectivity),
environmental effects (e.g., changes in ocean productivity), or
changes in sampling protocols
(e.g., shorter time frame over which samples are collected).
Declines in weight-at-age appear to have ceased since 2010.

### Abundance data

The spawn index survey collects information on
spatial extent of the spawn,
number of egg layers,
substrate type, and
other data.
There are two spawn survey periods defined by the predominant survey method:
surface survey period from `r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1` and
dive survey period from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`.
Data from these surveys are used to calculate egg density in each spawn.
Ultimately, we calculate the 'spawn index', 
the estimated biomass of mature spawners required to produce those eggs.
The `r surv_yr_rng[2]` spawn survey followed standard dive survey protocols
for the HG, PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI SARs as described in @cleary2018.
Time series of spawn index by major SAR
from `r paste(surv_yr_rng, collapse=" to ")`
are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index)
and Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) to \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi).

The surface survey methodology has been used on occasion
from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`. 
Generally this occurs when spawns are observed in locations where
a dive survey team is not available, or
when spawns are early (e.g., January or February) or
late (e.g., May) in the season. 
In these instances,
spawning biomass estimates obtained from surface surveys for
a given SAR and year are added to biomass estimates from dive surveys,
and $q_2 = 1$ is assumed for the combined index.
The \link{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16898404}{Pacific Herring data summaries}
show the proportion of spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index)
from the surface and dive survey methods by SAR and year.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only surface surveys were conducted
for HG in 2020 and 2021, and for PRD in 2020.
These surface survey observations are treated as dive survey observations and
are assumed to be continuous with the dive survey time series.
Methods for combining surface and dive survey observations are presented
for the SISCAH modelling framework in @dfo2023a, but are not implemented here.

## Spatial spawn distribution

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) through \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) 
summarize the spatial distribution of survey spawn biomass
(i.e., the spawn index)
by proportion over the last `r num_yrs_tab + 1` years for the major SARs.
For each SAR, spawn is summarized either by Group, or Statistical Area;
the choice of spatial grouping reflects spawning behaviour and
biology for each SAR based on the
survey data and working group discussions with local First Nations.

## Incidental mortality

Incidental mortality is described in @dfo2024 and
updated time series for each SAR can be found in 
\link{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16898404}{Pacific Herring data summaries}.
These data are not currently included as removals in Herring stock assessments.

## First Nations observations

Data and observations for the `r assess_yr` herring spawning season were contributed by 
representatives of First Nations communities for each SAR and can be found in
the \link{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16898404}{Pacific Herring data summaries}.
These observations include contributions from
the Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii; 
the Lax Kw’alaams Nations in Prince Rupert District;
the Wuikinuxv and Kitasoo Xai’xais Nations in the Central Coast; 
the Tla'amin, Homalko, and Qualicum Nations in Strait of Georgia; and
the Nuu-chah-nulth Nation on the West Coast of Vancouver Island.
Observations include: Spawn distribution and abundance, access, FSC successes
and challenges, fish behaviour, and comparison with previous seasons. 

## Stock status update

Analyses of stock trend information is presented following
methods of @cleary2018 for the Pacific Herring major SARs.
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs
have a chain length of `r number_to_word(mcmc_length)`
with a sample taken every `r number_to_word(mcmc_samp_freq)`
iterations (i.e., thinning).
Then the first `r number_to_word(mcmc_burnin)` samples are discarded
(i.e., burn-in),
leaving `r number_to_word(mcmc_num_samples)` samples as posteriors.
Perceptions of stock status based on outputs (i.e., posteriors)
from SCA models are summarized for each SAR
in a six-panel figure (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)).
The panels show:

a. Model fit to scaled spawn survey data,

a. Instantaneous natural mortality rate $M$ estimates,

a. Number of age-`r age_first` recruits,

a. Spawning biomass $\SB_t$ and total catch $C_t$,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$,

a. Recruitment deviations (log scale) from the
Beverton-Holt recruitment function, and

a. Spawning biomass production $P_t = \SB_{t+1} - \SB_t + C_{t+1}$
for the dive survey period,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$.

Note that spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index) is scaled to abundance
in panel (a) by the spawn survey scaling parameter $q$.
The spawn index has two distinct periods defined by the dominant survey method: 
surface surveys (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`) and 
dive surveys (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`).
Thus, two $q$ parameters are implemented in the estimation procedure:
$q_1$ (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`)
with a weakly informative prior, and
$q_2$ (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`)
with a strongly informative prior approximating 1.0.

### Reference points\label{sec:ref-pts}

A biological LRP is defined for the major
Pacific Herring SARs at $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017].
Candidate USRs were introduced in @cleary2018 and
implemented as biomass objectives in simulation analyses
for WCVI and SoG in 2018 [@dfo2019a], and
then for HG, PRD, and CC in 2019 [@dfo2019c].
An analysis of USR options was undertaken in 2022 with
results presented in @dfo2022a.
In total, five USR options were evaluated:

1. Average spawning biomass during a productive period
$\overline{\SB}_\mli{Prod}$
(i.e., a $B_\text{MSY}$ proxy; Table \@ref(tab:prod-period)),

1. $0.4\SB_0$,

1. $0.5\SB_0$,

1. $0.6\SB_0$, and

1. Average spawning biomass from `r major_start_yr` to `r assess_yr`
$\overline{\SB}$.

Implementing USRs as target biomass objectives within
the simulation-evaluation process allows evaluation of
MPs with respect to achieving USRs, 
including whether a given USR option can be achieved in the absence of 
commercial fisheries. 
In 2023, DFO Resource Management selected and implemented a provisional 
USR of $\overline{\SB}_\mli{Prod}$ through the 2022/2023 IFMP process.
Stock status relative to assessment model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$ (i.e., LRP) and
USR options are presented in
Tables \@ref(tab:ref-points-prd) through \@ref(tab:ref-points-wcvi).

LRPs and USRs relate stock status to the DFO PA Policy [@dfo2009], and
the same calculations are used for each Pacific Herring SAR.
There is an important distinction between reference points (e.g., LRP, USR) and
operational control points (OCPs) of the HCR
used to set catch limits.
Specifically, OCPs define the inflection points of a HCR and
identify biomass levels where management action is taken,
whereas LRPs and USRs are management objectives.

### Coast wide trends

Coast wide trends in Pacific Herring biomass show 
an average increasing trend in estimated spawning biomass
from mid-to-late 2000's to present. 
Catches have been stable since 1980 and declining over the last decade 
(Figure \@ref(fig:coastwide-biomass-catch)).
Comparisons of total estimated biomass and spawning biomass
are also included for each SAR
(Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-total-biomass));
these trends are presented using median posterior estimates.

### Haida Gwaii

Estimated spawning biomass historic lows occurred in the late 1960s predicated
by high catches, low estimated recruitment and high estimated natural mortality 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)). 
Under variable estimated recruitment,
estimated spawning biomass recovered from that point through the early 1980s
supported by declining rates of estimated natural mortality.
As estimated natural mortality began increasing again in the mid 1990s,
estimated biomass declined. 
A reprieve in estimated low biomass occurred following several years with 
above average estimated recruitment through the late 1990s,
before biomass declined to persistent historic lows from 2000 to present,
with a couple of low biomass peaks in 2013 and 2019
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)d).
The increasing trend in the estimated natural mortality rate starting in 1980
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)b) largely absorbed any surplus production
attributed to above average recruitment events
(e.g., 1997, 2012, 2018; Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)c, d).
Estimated natural mortality has been on a slow decline since the early 2000s
but low estimated recruitment has failed
to lead to a positive estimated productivity.

The HG stock persists in a low biomass state,
with many years also showing low productivity
which has largely precluded stock growth (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)f).
Above-average recruitment of age-`r age_first` fish in 2018, 
leading to increases in survey biomass in 2019 and 2020 were positive signs but 
average to below-average recruitment since then,
which estimates negative productivity,
has brought biomass back down to the LRP. 
The effective harvest rate $U_t$ has been at or near zero since 2000
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)),
with the last commercial roe fishery in 2002,
and the last commercial SOK fishery in 2004.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "HG", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`
Management measures to support long-term recovery of herring stocks in
Haida Gwaii are being developed through
the rebuilding plan process.$^{\ref{fn:rebuild}}$

### Central Coast

Estimated spawning biomass reached a historic high around 1980
preceded by low estimated natural mortality rates and the highest estimated 
recruitment on record (1979, Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)).
From there a decline in estimated spawning biomass
appears to be influenced initially by 
higher estimated natural mortality rates and
highly variable estimated recruitment.
Spawning biomass trend declined during the 1985-2008 period and 
an increase in estimated natural mortality led to
historically low estimated biomass levels from 2006 to 2012. 
Decreasing estimated natural mortality lead to moderate increases in 
biomass through 2020.
From 2021 to 2023,
increasing estimated natural mortality caused a decrease in estimated biomass,
which was mitigated in part by higher than average estimated recruitment in 2022
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a, b, e).
Model estimates show decreasing spawning biomass from 2020 to 2024,
with an increase in 2025
(Table \@ref(tab:cc-spawning-biomass-depletion)).
The analysis of surplus production shows an estimated production
close to neutral for 2021 and 2022, 
negative for 2023, and
positive for 2024
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)f).

An examination of spawn biomass by herring section shows
the recent decline in herring spawn to have largely occurred in
Upper Spiller Channel (Section 078),
Section 086,
Kitasu Bay/East Higgins (Section 067), and
Thompson/Stryker (Section 074; Figure \@ref(fig:spawn-section-cc)).
The occurrence of spawn in Thompson/Stryker from 2020 to 2022
represented the first significant spawns in this section in many years.
The mechanisms driving spawn fluctuations in these smaller areas in the 
Central Coast occur throughout the time series and are not well understood.

From 1990 to 2006 the effective harvest rate $U_t$ is estimated to fluctuate
above and below the reference harvest rate of `r target_hr*100`%,
with median estimates exceeding `r target_hr*100`% in some of these years
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
Occurrences of $U_t$ exceeding `r target_hr*100`% 
are due in part to positive assessment model errors and
lags in detecting a directional change in the trend.

Following a commercial fishery closure from 2007 to 2013,
the CC SAR was reopened to commercial fisheries:
commercial roe fisheries occurred in 2014, 2015, and 2016.
Commercial SOK fisheries have operated at some level most years since 2015
(see the
\link{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16898404}{Pacific Herring data summaries}).
SOK removals are not included in the estimation of $U_t$. 

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "CC", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The time series of estimated spawning biomass reached
an estimated peak in the mid to late 1970s
during a time period of lowest observed model estimates of natural mortality
and variable estimated recruitment 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)). 
From the late 1980s through to around 2008
an increase in estimated mortality and
a generally variable but low estimated recruitment led to a declining trend,
down from the peaks observed in the late 1970s
to a slump in the mid 2000s to mid 2010s
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a, b, c).

In the last 5 years productivity has increased with mostly higher than average 
recruitment and declining natural mortality estimates resulting in
increasing spawning biomass estimates not seen since the 1970s 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a, b, f).
Biomass estimates are nearing the highest since 1951.

The absence of a commercial fishery since 2005 means the realized harvest rate
has been zero for the last 15 years (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).

Previous years WCVI MCMC diagnostics showed parameter autocorrelation 
especially in the estimation of fishery selectivity-at-50% ($\hat{a}_1$) 
and its standard deviation ($\hat{\gamma}_1$)
for the "other" fisheries category
(i.e., reduction, food and bait, special use).
These results were largely ameliorated this year by changing parameter priors.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "WCVI", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`

## Management performance

<!-- TODO: Re-write for clarity and brevity -->
<!-- Historic management procedure performance can be assessed using -->
<!-- estimated effective harvest rate -->
<!-- $U_t = C_t/(C_t + \SB_t)$, where -->
<!-- $C_t$ is catch in year $t$, and -->
<!-- $\SB_t$ is estimated spawning biomass in year $t$ -->
<!-- (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)). -->

<!-- TODO: Move this to the figure caption -->
<!-- Note that lines showing $U_t = 20\%$ are reference lines only and -->
<!-- do not indicate annual management decisions on TAC for each SAR. -->

Historic management procedure performance can be assessed using
the time series of effective harvest rate $U$.
Estimated effective harvest rate $U$ in each year $t$ is
$U_t = C_t/(C_t + \SB_t)$, where
$C_t$ is catch in year $t$, and
$\SB_t$ is estimated spawning biomass in year $t$.
Time series of $U_t$
are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate), where $U_t$ of 20%
is used as a reference line only and is not indicative of annual management
decisions on TAC for each SAR.

## Application of MPs and harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`\label{sec:harv-opts}

Harvest options for PRD, CC, and WCVI for `r assess_yr+1` reflect
application of simulation-tested MPs using the Herring OM [@benson2022]. 
OM conditioning was updated in 2022 using historic stock and fishery data
from `r major_start_yr` to 2021; no MP updates were conducted for 2023 or 2024.
MPs are not provided for HG because this is now conducted within the
HG rebuilding plan process$^{\ref{fn:rebuild}}$
and MPs for SoG are provided in [@dfo2025b].

### Haida Gwaii

The HG stock persisted in a low biomass state
from approximately 2000-2018 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)).
The stock was below the LRP for much of that period and shows
little evidence of sustained stock growth despite the absence of
commercial fisheries since 2002 (and since 2004 for the SOK fishery).
Survey biomass increased from 2019 to 2020,
remained stable in 2021,
and declined from 2021 to 2023,
with a slight increase in 2024.
Results of the simulation-evaluations found that none of the proposed MPs, 
including the historical and no fishing MPs,
maintained spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability
[i.e., at least 75%, @dfo2009].\footnote{\label{fn:HighProb}``High'' probability
is defined as 75 to 95\% by the DFO decision-making framework (DFO 2009).}

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "HG", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

Given it's prolonged low biomass state,
a rebuilding plan was required for Haida Gwaii Pacific Herring. 
A comprehensive plan was co-developed by the Council of Haida Nation, 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Parks Canada and was finalized in 
April 2024.$^{\ref{fn:rebuild}}$

Guidance for developing rebuilding plans [@dfo2013] states that
the primary objective of any rebuilding plan is to
promote stock growth out of the Critical Zone
(i.e., to grow the stock above the status-based LRP) by
ensuring removals from all fishing sources are kept to the lowest possible level
until the stock has cleared this zone with high probability.
However, stock rebuilding does not end having met this goal, and
one of the goals of the rebuilding plan will be to
identify candidate threshold biomass levels greater than the LRP
that are consistent with a rebuilt state.

Based on MP evaluations and the ongoing rebuilding plan process,
the harvest recommendation for the Haida Gwaii stock in
`r assess_yr + 1` is 0&nbsp;t.
All future MP evaluations will occur through the rebuilding plan process.

### Central Coast

The CC stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from
approximately 2005 to 2014.
An increasing trend was observed from 2015 to 2020,
followed by a decline from 2021 to 2024
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a).

In the summer of 2022, we updated the conditioning of the MSE operating model
for CC with 2021 spawn, catch, and biological data.
These latest MP evaluations also appear in @dfo2022a.
No new MPs were included,
however probability metrics for the five USRs options 
[@dfo2022a] were estimated and have been added to the harvest options tables.
The updated simulations show that MPs with harvest rates at 5% and 10% 
maintain spawning biomass above the LRP with 81 to 91% probability over
both OM scenarios (Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc)).
`r mean_harvest_text(SAR = "CC", translate = french)`

Harvest options listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc) reflect
application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1` forecast biomass for CC,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective
with a minimum 75% probability under both DDM and DIM OM scenarios.

Since multiple MPs meet the conservation objective of
maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with at least 75% probability,
other socio-economic objectives may drive the choice for a particular MP. 
Additionally, the current CC OM is unable to directly address
Heilstuk Nation conservation objectives related to herring age and size, nor 
objectives on a finer spatial scale or those specific to SOK fisheries.
These limitations exist for all five major SARs.

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "CC", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

Finally, DFO acknowledges commitment to the Heiltsuk Nation for
the development of a Joint Fisheries Management Plan for Pacific Herring
in the Central Coast in `r assess_yr + 1`.
Results presented here may inform this ongoing commitment.

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The WCVI stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from
approximately 2004 to 2014.
In recent years, biomass has increased above the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$ and
has sustained higher biomass since 2022.

In 2022, with updated 2021 data, closed-loop feedback simulations
for WCVI show the conservation objective is met
under the DDM OM scenario with between 80 and 84% probability,
and the same MPs failed to meet the conservation objective under the DIM 
OM scenario, where natural mortality rates are
most similar to the last 10 years ($p$ between 61 to 65%).

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "WCVI", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs,
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi).
These options reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1`
forecast biomass for WCVI, under the two OM scenarios.

## Ecosystem and climate change considerations

Stock assessment models for Pacific Herring
incorporate ecosystem and climate change indirectly
via processes such as natural mortality and recruitment,
both of which represent the foundations of historical stock productivity.
Over the years, scientists and First Nations have expressed the need
to examine the role of ecosystem changes in driving
variation and trends in these Pacific Herring productivity processes,
especially considering the importance of future productivity
in evaluating harvest management procedures
(i.e., as part of the management strategy evaluation process).
This also aligns with DFOs commitment to
advance Ecosystem Approaches to Fisheries Management.

### Reference points

The ecosystem context of herring as a mid-trophic level
(i.e., middle-of-the-food-chain) species
is taken into account in the establishement of reference points.
The biological LRP is set to a higher value compared to those
recommended in the DFO sustainable fisheries policy [@dfo2009] and
above the recommendation of 0.5$B_{MSY}$
which is implemented in New Zealand fisheries [@shelton2008].
Candidate USRs [@dfo2022a] incorporate area-specific ecosystem considerations,
including to reflect states (historical time frames)
of higher stock biomass and variable levels of stock productivity.
Both the LRP and USRs are included in the MSE process.

### Haida Gwaii

@boldt2022 identified possible environmental and biological pressures
that link to herring distribution, growth, and production.
Environmental pressures include
the timing, duration, and magnitude of upwelling,
which can affect the amount of prey available to
herring [@mackas2001; @hourston2019; @boldt2018], as well as
predation and competition [@godefroid2019].
Other physical environmental pressures include sea surface temperature (SST),
salinity, sea level, river discharge, and Ekman transport
[@tester1948; @alderdice1985; @stocker1985; @stocker1988;
@schweigert1990; @ware1991; @zebdi1995].
These indicators are described in more detail
in the 2023 Science Response [@dfo2024].
Additional work is needed to incorporate mechanistic-linked indicators into the
new modelling framework for HG herring.

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

Uu-a-thluk Fisheries began a research program in 2020 to examine the role of
(i) predation,
(ii) spawn distribution, and
(iii) life history characteristics in
Pacific Herring productivity.\footnote{\label{fn:wcvi2021}

\footnote{\label{fn:wcvi2025}
Uu-a-thluk Fisheries (2025), [?aayaaqa] (herring) spawn dynamics.}
Those studies found relatively large changes in the predation regimes
for Pacific Herring stocks that spend considerable parts
of their life cycle in offshore oceanic habitats.
Furthermore, the results also show that
stock assessments at smaller spatial scales are able to
more precisely model the spatial dynamics of Pacific Herring
without drastic declines in statistical performance.
Although the role of predation and ecosystem change
varies among Pacific Herring stock assessment units,
there are shared processes and commonalities among units
in how ecosystems and climate affect productivity. 

This section summarizes Pacific Herring productivity studies and
their implications for the West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI)
Pacific Herring stock assessment region.

#### Changing predation regimes

Ecosystem effects are included in Pacific Herring models
via population dynamics that represent how historical predator consumption
could contribute to observed changes in natural mortality (Doherty et al. 2024).
Predators include Humpback Whales (*Megaptera novaeangliae*),
Harbour Seals (*Phoca vitulina*), Steller Sea Lions (*Eumetopias jubatus*), and 
Pacific Hake (*Merluccius productus*),
which prey on herring during most of their annual life cycle
(Figure \@ref(fig:wcvi-eco-concept-one)).

Consumption of Pacific Herring by each predator
is estimated via bio-energetics modeling (Chasco et al. 2017, Doherty et al. 2024),
accounting for average predator size, estimated abundance, size preference,
foraging days, diet composition, and the energy content of Pacific Herring
(Doherty et al. 2024).
These predation models provide estimates of
current stock biomass and historical total natural mortality
that are consistent with existing stock assessments.

While the predation model agrees with the existing assessment
on the stock history (e.g., biomass, mortality, recruitment),
projections of future biomass and productivity from the predation model
differ due to ecosystem impacts from predators.
The predation model estimates a lower unfished biomass for WCVI,
which results in different perceptions of stock status ($B/B[0]$),
despite both models having similar estimates of current biomass
(Table 2 in Doherty et al. 2024).
Expectations for future biomass growth for WCVI herring are
smaller in comparison to previous assessments
that do not model predator consumption
due to higher rates of predation mortality in recent years and
projected increases in future predator biomass.
In contrast, the random walk projections of natural mortality
used in the current assessment
rely heavily on analyst choice about future trends,
which influences the perception of risk when making fishing decisions
under uncertainty (see implications section below for further discussion).
Changing future productivity is expected for WCVI herring,
where local knowledge and models suggest that
predation is a driver of natural mortality.
Total estimated consumption of herring by predators increased from
7 kt in the late 1990s to 13 kt in recent years
(Figure \@ref(fig:wcvi-eco-predators)) and
is expected to increase further as the abundance of
Steller Sea Lions (and possibly Humpback Whales) increases.

#### Spatial dynamics and spawn distribution

The historical distribution of WCVI herring spawning abundance
shows relatively consistent core areas within PFMAs.
PFMA 23 has the most consistent spawning in section 232, while
242 and 245 are most consistent for PFMA 24, and
section 253 is the most consistent spawning area for PFMA 25
(Figure \@ref(fig:wcvi-eco-quilt)).

Based on these distinct areas,
the single-stock stock assessment model data for WCVI herring
was disaggregated into three independent stocks corresponding to
PFMAs 23, 24, and 25
to examine the potential for higher spatial resolution
assessments$^{\ref{fn:wcvi2025}}$ (Figure \@ref(fig:wcvi-eco-concept-two)).
Simulations of future average unfished biomass for the 3-stock model
accounting for predation indicate that 2023 biomass
in PFMAs 23, 24, and 25 is 91%, 140%, and 85% of unfished levels,
respectively.$^{\ref{fn:wcvi2025}}$
Statistical performance of the three-stock model
was comparable to the single stock assessment and
represents a potentially practical way
to incorporate greater spatial detail in ecosystem processes and fisheries, and
to represent Uu-a-thluk objectives.

#### Life history characteristics

Empirical analyses of data collected during herring spawn events found
egg production per gram of bodyweight (fecundity) increases with age, and
that older herring spawn later,
consistent with findings for Pacific Herring stocks outside of Canada (Shelton et al. 2014). 

#### Implications for science advice

Changing ecosystems and climate are implicitly represented
in historical science advice for Pacific Herring;
however, their impact on future herring productivity
is of most importance for management.
Changes in natural mortality and recruitment are
neither random nor independent of Pacific Herring or predator abundance
(Doherty et al. 2024).
This finding should be integrated into the MSE process. 

Historical and future changes to Pacific Herring ecosystems
imply a need to modify expectations for future biomass and fisheries, and
to account for this in the choice of management objectives.
For example, biomass targets (or upper stock reference points)
recently proposed for WCVI herring were based on a productive period
in the recent history (DFO 2023):
‘maintain spawning stock biomass at or above a target biomass level
equivalent to the average biomass from 1990-1999,
with at least 50% probability over three herring generations’.
This objective was updated from an earlier version proposed by
the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council that had a higher probability threshold
of 75% that could not be achieved in simulations (DFO 2021).
Future MSE analyses should include scenarios
with changing predation regimes that
inhibit the stock’s ability to return to previous biomass levels.
