# Analysis and response

## COVID-19 pandemic

Compared to 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had fewer impacts
to Pacific Herring data collection and analysis in 2021.
Spawn surveys proceeded as usual in most areas in 2021,
with dive surveys in all major areas except Haida Gwaii.
Haida Gwaii would normally have a dive survey,
but had surface surveys in 2021 due to COVID-19.
The collection and analysis of biological data was not affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021

## Management strategy evaluation

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has committed to renewing the current management framework to
address a range of challenges facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in British Columbia. 
Renewal of the management framework for Pacific Herring uses MSE to evaluate the performance 
of candidate MPs against hypotheses about past and future stock and fishery dynamics. 
The purpose of the MSE process is to identify MPs that provide acceptable outcomes related to conservation and fishery management objectives. 
The identification of a preferred management procedure requires a fully specified set of measurable objectives that 
include reference points (typically categorized as limits and targets) and to the extent possible, 
specification of objectives related to catch, catch variability, and socio-cultural goals. 
MSE is an iterative and ongoing process conducted with the participation of
First Nations, the fishing industry, as well as government and non-government organizations.  

The first MSE cycles for the SoG and WCVI management areas were completed in 2018 [@dfo2019a].
Steps included OM development, fitting the OMs to Pacific Herring stock and fishery monitoring data from 1951 to 2017, 
and closed-loop simulations of MP performance for alternative future natural mortality scenarios [@dfo2019a].
In the spring of 2019, the MSE process was extended to the HG, PRD, and CC management areas
with stock and fishery monitoring data updated to include 2018
and performance evaluation of area specific MPs [@dfo2019c].
In the summer of 2020 the second MSE cycle was initiated for the WCVI and SoG management areas.
This included conditioning the OMs with more recent stock and fishery data,
and evaluating the performance of additional candidate MPs for these management areas.
A similar update was conducted in the summer of 2021 for the PRD and CC management areas.
Results from MP evaluations reflect most recent updates for all management areas.

A core set of fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c] have been applied to each major SAR:

1. Maintain spawning biomass above the LRP with at least 75% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t > 0.3\SB_0) \geq 0.75$),

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., achieve a target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.6\SB_0) \geq 0.5$),

1. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25% over three Pacific Herring generations
(goal reflecting catch variability; $\text{AAV} < 0.25$), and

1. Maximize average annual catch over three Pacific Herring generations
(goal reflecting catch biomass).

However, a fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed for each management area.
DFO will continue to collaborate with coastal First Nations to develop area-specific objectives specific to Food, Social and Ceremonial fisheries as well as spawn-on-kelp (SOK) fisheries.
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with the herring industry, government, and non-government organizations
to describe broader objectives related to conservation, economics, and access.

The MPs for each SAR differ in the form of the HCR and choices of catch cap,
but use the same type of monitoring data and assessment model [e.g., @cleary2018].
The current stock assessment model assumes natural mortality is time-varying and this
is reflected in the MSE as three hypotheses about future Pacific Herring natural mortality $M$: 

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-dependent process (DDM),

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-independent process (DIM), and

1. $M$ is constant over time (conM).

These three hypotheses are captured as three operating model (OM) scenarios in @dfo2019a.
The DDM scenario was identified as the Reference OM scenario based on discussion at the July 2018 CSAS review process [@dfo2019c],
while the DIM and conM scenarios were identified as Robustness OM scenarios.
There is however currently no scientifically supported method for predicting the natural mortality and thus all three scenarios are included. 

Several lessons were learned from the MSE analyses conducted so far:

1. The catch-at-age stock assessment model can produce large (positive) assessment errors.
Such assessment errors cause over-estimation of spawning biomass and
result in recommended catch limits such that the realized harvest rate exceeds the intended target specified by a HCR (e.g., over-harvest).

1. Reduction in harvest rate from 20% to 10% was the most effective means of mitigating 
stock assessment errors by reducing the absolute size of the catch.
The use of a catch cap, implemented as a maximum annual catch level, 
was an effective model-free way to further mitigate assessment errors at very high biomass levels.
Simulation analyses additionally showed that outcomes are insensitive to the choice of
operational control points (OCPs) in the HCR when a low harvest rate (HR) and catch cap are applied.
This occurs because low biomass levels (associated with the lower OCP) are avoided for these MPs.

1. Differences in specification of Pacific Herring MPs, including the HCR components, are expected a priori among SARs.
The reasons relate to differences in objectives deemed important by resource users,
differences in historical and current stock and fishery dynamics, and
differences in the magnitude and direction of assessment model errors in each SAR.
Conservation objectives such as those based on avoiding a threshold to serious harm (i.e., a limit reference point) 
in alignment with the DFO PA Framework [@dfo2009] are held constant among SARs based on the analyses of @kronlund2017.

1. There are many possible ways to incorporate MP performance in robustness trials into decision-making but, 
there is currently no accepted scientific way of combining results from multiple operating models.

1. In situations where multiple MPs meet the agreed upon objectives, further criteria, such as ranking secondary objectives, is 
needed in order to provide decision-makers with a tractable set of trade-off choices.

1. Outcomes of MP evaluations appear to be influenced by the last three to five years of stock status and 
natural mortality trends used to condition the  OM. 
If simulations were run over a greater number of years (i.e., 50 years) performance would start to approach equilibrium and be 
unaffected by most recent trends in OM conditioning data.

## Input data

There are three types of input data used for the Pacific Herring stock assessment: catch data, biological data, and abundance data.
These data sets are described in the following sections, and summarized in Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Relative to the previous assessment, the only change made to input data was to update all data time series to include data from the `r this_season` herring season (July 1 to June 30).
Note that we refer to 'year' instead of 'herring season' in this report;
therefore `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season` Pacific Herring season.

### Catch data

For the purposes of stock assessment, catch data are summarized by gear type as described in Table \@ref(tab:data-input) and presented in Figure \@ref(fig:major-catch).
As in previous years, catch input to the stock assessment model does not include mortality from the commercial SOK fishery, nor any recreational fisheries or food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) harvest.
The FSC and recreational harvest are considered minor relative to commercial harvest.
The commercial SOK fishery is licensed based on pounds of validated SOK product (i.e., eggs adhered to kelp), not tonnes of fish used or spawned.
Currently there is no basis for validating mortality imposed on the population by this fishery, however methods for estimating SOK mortality are being developed.

Combined commercial removals from `r assess_yr-9` to `r assess_yr` from the roe, food and bait, and special use fisheries appear in Table \@ref(tab:annual-catch).
The proportion of coast-wide catch that comes from the SoG was 22% in 1990, and 100% in `r assess_yr`.
Total SOK harvest (pounds of validated product) for the major SARs from `r assess_yr-9` to `r assess_yr` is presented in Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch).



### Biological data\label{sec:biol-data}

Biological samples are collected as described in @cleary2018 and Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Biological data inputs to the stock assessment are annual weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-wa)) and 
annual numbers-at-age, shown as proportions-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-pa)).

Significant declines in weight-at-age are evident for all major herring stocks, from the mid-1980s to 2010.
Declining weight-at-age may be attributed to any number of factors, including
fishing effects (i.e., gear selectivity),
environmental effects (e.g., changes in ocean productivity), or
changes in sampling protocols (e.g., shorter time frame over which samples are collected).
There has been an increasing trend in weight-at-age for all major stocks from 2012 to `r assess_yr`, although to a lesser degree for PRD.

### Abundance data

The spawn index survey collects information on spawn length (parallel to shore), spawn width (perpendicular to shore), number of egg layers by vegetation type, and other data.
There are two spawn survey periods defined by the predominant survey method:
surface period from `r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`, and
dive period from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`.
Data from these surveys are used to calculate egg densities per spawn.
Ultimately, the estimated weight of mature spawners required to produce the egg deposition is calculated and referred to as the 'spawn index'.
The `r surv_yr_rng[2]` spawn survey followed standard dive survey protocols
for the PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI SARs as described in @cleary2018, and
a surface survey protocol for the HG SAR due to COVID-19.
Time series of spawn index by major stock assessment region
from `r paste(surv_yr_rng, collapse=" to ")`
are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index).
In `r surv_yr_rng[2]`, there was an
increase in survey biomass (i.e., index values) for the PRD and WCVI SARs, and
a decrease in survey biomass for HG, CC, and SoG SARs
(Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index) and
Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) to \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi)).

## Spatial spawn distribution

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) through \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) 
summarize the spatial distribution of survey spawn biomass (i.e., the spawn index)
by proportion over the most recent `r num_yrs_tab+1` years for the major SARs.
HG and SoG are summarized by Group, while PRD, CC, and WCVI are summarized by Statistical Area;
the choice of spatial grouping reflects spawning behaviour and biology for each SAR based on the 
survey data and working group discussions with local First Nations.

## Incidental catch

In order to advance progress towards a holistics ecosystem-based management (EBM) 
approach for Pacific Herring we are presenting here the information currently 
available to describe indirect effects on herring populations, such as incidental mortality. 
Some fisheries and aquaculture activities in BC cause
incidental mortality to Pacific Herring.
Similar to SOK harvest as well as FSC and recreational catch,
incidental catch is currently only indirectly accounted for 
in the Pacific Herring stock assessment through the annual mortality estimates, 
and is considered minor relative to commercial harvest.
However, incidental catch from finfish aquaculture
has been made available to the Herring Science Team. 
We are including newly available information on estimated incidental catch in
aquaculture activities by SAR from `r min(ic_yrs)` to `r max(ic_yrs)`
(Figure \@ref(fig:major-incidental)).

Incidental catch data are reported by Pacific Fishery Management Area (PFMA)
which are analogous to Statistical Areas, but
PFMAs are larger and can extend beyond SAR boundaries.
Data indicate the number of Pacific Herring dead and released,
with the following caveats:

1. Catch data for 2020 are considered incomplete,

2. Unknown mortality rate for "released" fish,

3. Unknown length, weight, age, and sex of fish, and

4. "Herring-like" fish are assumed to be herring
when decomposition hinders identification.

## First Nations observations

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact First Nations participation
in herring survey activities as well as participation
in traditional harvest activities (FSC). 
Assembling local observations was not possible for the 2020 season,
however in 2021, local observations were provided by
coastal First Nations participants for most areas.
<!-- TODO: JC to check this next sentence -->
The following text in this section is provided by First Nations collaborators.

### Haida Gwaii

\textbf{Selwyn and Cumshewa Inlets}

This stock has seen steady declines over the past decade to the point where this past season there almost was no spawn to be found. 
The spawn occurred very late in the season (late April) and was in outer Selwyn near Rockfish Harbour (rather than inside Selwyn near Traynor Bay). 
The spawn this year was considered to be fairly minimal for Selwyn Inlet standards and insufficient to extend into Cumshewa Inlet.

\textbf{Skincuttle and Upper Burnaby}

This year the bulk of the spawning occurred on the Skincuttle side, but in other years it has occurred more north of the narrows in upper Burnaby Strait. This stock is just barely maintaining itself. Abundance is low enough that natural recruitment just barely makes up for natural mortality – so we see some years of slight recovery followed by other years of decline, but no real growth even in the absence of a fishery now in almost 20 years.

\textbf{Juan Perez Sound}

These inlets normally will support spawns when there are a lot of recruits in the population and first time spawners can out number old repeat spawners. That has not been the case now for some time. Lately spawns have been small and infrequent in the inlets of Juan Perez Sound, as was the case in 2021.

\textbf{Louscoone Inlet}

There has not been a significant presence of herring abundance in outer Louscoone for a number of years now. In years of abundance, the local stock was always found to be well up inside the inlet and often presented a very light spawn near the head in the early portion of the season (early to mid March). This stock seldom exceeded 500 ton – however in recent years it has been much less. The other stock appears to be more migratory- found in the outer portions of Louscoone Inlet and rarely spawns in Louscoone. One theory is outer Louscoone is used as a staging area and that these herring would then migrate elsewhere (possibly to the in the Central Coast) to spawn. Now, abundance is not high enough to allow herring to build up in outer Louscoone early in the season – so we only see evidence of the minor local stock.

\textbf{Traditional harvest}

There was some effort for the traditional harvest of k’aaw in both Skincuttle Inlet and Selwyn Inlet in early to mid April, 2021. 
The open kelp lines set up in Jedway Bay, Skincuttle Inlet, were successful with approximately 2,000 lbs of good quality k’aaw being harvested. 
The open kelp lines set up in the cove just south of Traynor Bay, Selwyn Inlet, were unsuccessful due to the absence of spawn. 
There were no other (known) attempts for the harvest of k’aaw on Haida Gwaii during the 2021 herring season.

### Prince Rupert District

Observations from the Lax Kw’alaams Band:
Overall, very little spawn was observed this season by members and staff.
Lax Kw’alaams Fisheries Technicians,
in coordination with Metlakatla Guardians,
spent ten full days during the herring season
monitoring harvest and recording herring behaviour and locations.
During the surveys,
technicians were unable to locate herring schools in
any of the normal geographic areas monitored each year.
This year in the Prince Rupert District,
Lax Kw’alaams had several fishermen out on the water.
On-grounds correspondence with harvesters confirmed that herring spawn in the 
2021 season was quite poor and ephemeral, and
most reported seeing no active herring spawning in important harvest areas.
However, the FSC harvest incidentally reported spawn in a couple of areas and
was more promising than previous years.
A few more community members were able to obtain some spawn-on-branches
for the first time in many years,
with sufficient layers to justify a small harvest.
However, Lax Kw’alaams fishermen were unable to gather enough herring
to satisfy FSC needs for the majority of the community.

### Central Coast

### Strait of Georgia

\textbf{Northern SoG}

A-Tlegay Fisheries assisted the herring assessment program by providing additional dive survey coverage and attempting to collect cast net samples on active spawns. 
A-Tlegay divers surveyed spawn from Willow Point south down to Bates Beach (and beyond), Herring Sections 135 and 141.
Through an outreach program, spawns were also reported to A-Tlegay from local mainland inlet areas.
As a result, A-Tlegay was able to dive on two spawns in Bute Inlet and 1 spawn in Teakerne Arm (Section 151).

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

In general, herring spawn was sporadic and short in duration
in Barkley and Nootka Sounds
with a spawn lasting several days in Hesquiaht Harbour.  

In Nootka, herring were in the deep off of Yuquot for a couple of weeks
and then they moved outside to Bajo Reef/Beano Creek area in mid-March.
Bird and marine mammal activity shifted from the vicinity of
Yuquot out to Bajo/Beano area.
Ray Williams of Yuquot reported a small spawn in the lower end of Tahsis Inlet,
but it could not be located by the spawn reconnaissance crew.
There was a small harvest of spawn on kelp (60 lbs. total)
just off the rocks of Escalante. 

There was a small spawn in the shallows in the Port Langford area of Nuchatlitz
on March 9th and later in Rosa Harbour.
Only 20% of the trees set for spawn-on-bough collections were successful in the area.  

In Area 23, the spawns were small and short in duration around mid-March.
The main spawn was around Muscle Beach to Macoha on March 12.
Most trees set for spawn-on-boughs collections reported having mostly 2 to 4
layers of eggs and were set back in the water to hatch.

There were several trees for home use set by First Nations
at this active spawn during sample collections.
Activity was noted in front of the beach North and South of Maggie River
but they did not appear to be actively spawning.
Other spawn investigated around this time was at Mussel beach.
At the end of March a small spawn was reported at Lyall point. 

In Area 24, most spawning activity was in and around Hesquiaht Harbour
from about the first week in March until near the end of the month.
Hesquiaht Harbour is not a great area for SOB due to the prevalence
of sandy bottom  substrates and windy conditions.  

## Stock status update

Analyses of stock trend information for AM2 are presented following
methods of @cleary2018 for the Pacific Herring major SARs.
Perceptions of stock status based on outputs from the SCA model (AM2)
are summarized for each stock in a multi-panel figure
(e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)).
The panels show:

a. Model fit to scaled spawn survey data,

a. Instantaneous natural mortality rate $M$ estimates,

a. Number of age-`r age_first` recruits,

a. Spawning biomass $\SB_t$ and total catch $C_t$ in year $t$,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$,

a. Recruitment deviations (log scale) from the
Beverton-Holt recruitment function, and

a. Spawning biomass production ($\frac{\SB_{t+1} - \SB_t + C_{t+1}}{\SB_t}$)
for the dive survey period,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$.

Note that spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index) is scaled to abundance
in panel (a) by the spawn survey scaling parameter $q$.
The spawn index has two distinct periods defined by the dominant survey method: 
surface surveys (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`), and 
dive surveys (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`).
Thus, two $q$ parameters are implemented in the estimation procedure:
$q_1$ (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`) with an uninformative prior, and
$q_2$ (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`) with an informative prior approximating 1.0.

The surface survey methodology has been used on occasion from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`. 
Generally this occurs in instances when herring spawn is observed in locations where a dive survey team is not available, or
when spawning occurs very early (January or February) or late (May) in the season. 
In these instances,
spawning biomass estimates obtained from surface surveys for
a given stock area and year are added to
biomass estimates from dive surveys, and $q_2 = 1$ is assumed for the combined index.
In 2020 and `r surv_yr_rng[2]`, a full surface survey was conducted for the HG SAR and
in this assessment the resulting survey biomass estimates are
assumed continuous with the dive survey time series.

### Reference points\label{sec:ref-pts}

A biological limit reference point (LRP) is defined for the major
Pacific Herring SARs at $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017].
Candidate upper stock references (USR) were introduced in @cleary2018 and
implemented as biomass objectives in the simulation analyses for WCVI and SoG
in 2018 [@dfo2019a] and then for HG, PRD, and CC in 2019 [@dfo2019c].
Candidate USRs are:

1. $0.4\SB_0$,

1. $0.6\SB_0$,

1. Average spawning biomass from `r major_start_yr` to `r assess_yr`, $\SB_{\mli{ave}}$, and

1. Average spawning biomass during a productive period [@cleary2018], $\SB_{\mli{ave-prod}}$.

Simulation results showed similar properties between USRs
$0.6\SB_0$ and $\SB_{\mli{ave}}$ both within and among SARs,
while the USR based on the average biomass in a productive period,
$\SB_{\mli{ave-prod}}$, was found to be most variable among SARs.
The simulation-evaluations did not select a single USR,
however a USR of $0.6\SB_0$ is included in this stock status update because
this candidate is sufficiently above the LRP (2*LRP) and
it is a repeatable calculation across all SARs.
Stock status relative to the assessment model estimates $0.3\SB_0$ (LRP) and
$0.6\SB_0$ (one candidate USR) are presented for each SAR
in Tables \@ref(tab:ref-points-hg) through \@ref(tab:ref-points-wcvi).

The LRP and USR relate stock status to the DFO PA Framework [@dfo2009], and
in the assessment of Pacific Herring the same calculations are applied for each SAR.
There is an important distinction between reference points (e.g., LRP, USR) and
operational control points of the harvest control rule (HCR)
or the management procedure used to set catch limits.
Specifically, operational control points (OCPs) define the inflection points
of a HCR, and identify biomass levels where management action is taken.
For example, the harvest rate is set to zero and fishing ceases when
biomass falls below the lower OCP.

### Haida Gwaii

Estimated spawning biomass declined to near historic lows in the mid-1990s and
briefly increased through the late 1990s before falling to
persistent historic lows from 2000 to 2010 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)d).
A modest increase in estimated spawning biomass occurred during the early 2010s
before falling once again to near historic lows from 2016 to 2018.
The modest increase can be attributed to increases in the spawn index in
2013 and 2015 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)a) that were supported by
above average recruitment of age-`r age_first` fish in 2012
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)c, d).
An increasing trend in the estimated natural mortality rate since 1980
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)b) largely absorbed surplus production
attributable to above average recruitment events
(e.g., 1997 and 2012; Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)c, d).
Estimated natural mortality has increased sharply since the early 2010s
following a decline from a peak rate around 2002.
Since 2000, the HG stock has been in a low biomass state,
with many of these years also showing low productivity
which has precluded stock growth (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)f).
There is an increase in survey biomass in 2019 and 2020, and
above-average recruitment of age-2s in 2018, and
below-average recruitment in 2019 and 2020.
In the most recent two years, between 2019 and 2020 and 2020 and 2021,
production is estimated to be neither positive nor negative
(i.e., production is 0),
preceded by two consecutive years of positive productivity.
Overall, biomass remains low relative to historical patterns and
natural mortality rates remain at historic high levels (up to 2016).
The most recent 3 years show a decline in estimated natural mortality,
responding to an increase in spawn biomass (2019-2021) and
below average recruitment (2019-2021).
The effective harvest rate $U_t$ since 2000 has been at or near zero
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)),
with the last commercial roe fishery in 2002,
and the last commercial SOK fishery in 2004.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "HG")`
Management measures to support long-term recovery of herring stocks in
Haida Gwaii are being developed through the Rebuilding Plan process
(Section '\nameref{sec:harv-opts}').

### Prince Rupert District

Estimated spawning biomass recovered by the mid-1980s from
historic low depletion levels following the collapse of the 1960s,
to about 50% of the historic high biomass estimated in the early 1960s
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)d).
However, after the mid-1980s, estimated spawning biomass steadily declined before
stabilizing at a relatively low level (but above historic lows) by around 2005.
The estimated stock biomass has shown little trend from 2005 to 2018,
with a modest increase in 2019.
Survey biomass in 2020 is near-identical to that of 2019;
biomass increased again in 2021.
Fluctuations in the trend in spawning biomass appear to be less
than those observed in other SARs,
possibly because some spawn index points are being under- or over-fit
(e.g., 2001 to 2004, and 2010 to 2013)
as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)a.
Estimated natural mortality reached historic highs in the late 1960s,
before declining through the late 1970s.
Beginning in about 1980, estimated natural mortality increased through to 2005, 
roughly doubling from 0.25 to 0.5&nbsp;$\text{yr}^{-1}$ 
and then stabilized from 2005 to 2021 at a median rate of 0.45
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)b).
The trend in natural mortality from 1980 to 2005 coincides with
the decline in spawning biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)d),
during which recruitment deviations fluctuated around 0
without any strong positive or negative trends
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)e).
Above average age-`r age_first`+ recruitments in 2014, 2017 and 2018,
and an increase in the spawn index in the last three years
appears to be sufficient to lead to an increase in estimated spawning biomass
in 2019 through 2021, relative to 2018 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)f).
Commercial catches from 2007 to 2018 have remained low (below 2,000&nbsp;t) and
there was no commercial catch in 2019, 2020, or 2021.
The estimated natural mortality appears to be unchanged from last year,
resulting in what appears to be a small increase in production
between 2018 and 2019, sustaining the 2019 biomass increase through 2021.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "PRD")`
Commercial fisheries have occurred annually in PRD since the mid-1980s,
with the exception of 2019 to 2021,
during which the effective harvest rate $U_t$ was estimated to be at or below 20% 
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)) in all years except 1989.

### Central Coast

Estimated spawning biomass declined from a historic high around 1980
to historic low levels in the period of 2005 to 2015
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)d).
An increase in spawning stock biomass was estimated through the mid-2010s
but remained below levels estimated prior to 2000,
with survey biomass declining in 2017, 2018 and 2021.
In 2019 there was an increase in estimated spawning biomass,
with a similar level estimated for 2020.
The estimated biomass trend largely reflects the trend in the spawn index
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a),
where fluctuations correspond opposite to the fluctuations in
estimated natural mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)b).
For example, the decline in spawn index (and estimated spawning biomass) to
the historic lows around 2008 followed an increasing trend in
estimated natural mortality through the same period.
Estimated natural mortality moderated around 2008,
which was followed by an increase in spawn index (and estimated spawning biomass) 
until 2017 whereupon natural mortality ceased declining.
Recruitment deviations were slightly negative
(i.e., lower than predicted by the stock-recruit function)
on average from about 1990 to 2017,
and were above average in 2019 and 2020 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)e).
The model estimates very similar spawning biomass from 2019 through 2021
(Table \@ref(tab:cc-spawning-biomass-depletion)),
and the analysis of surplus production shows there is evidence of
strong production in the year between 2016/2017 and between 2018/2019,
similar to the 1990 to 1999 period (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)f).
However, surplus production is estimated to be negative
in the years between 2019/2020 and 2020/2021.

An examination of spawn biomass by Herring Section shows
the recent decline in herring spawn to have largely occurred in
Spiller Channel (Sections 072 and 078) and
Kitasu Bay (Section 067; Figure \@ref(fig:spawn-section-cc)).
The majority of spawn in 2021 occurred in Thompson/Stryker (Section 074).
Occurrence of spawn in Thompson/Stryker in 2020 and 2021
represents the first significant spawns for this section in many years.

A fixed cutoff HCR was implemented in 1986, and
from 1986 to 2007 the effective harvest rate $U_t$ is estimated to fluctuate
above and below the `r target_hr*100`% target rate,
with median estimates exceeding `r target_hr*100`% frequently
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
Occurrences of $U_t$ exceeding the `r target_hr*100`% target harvest rate
are due in part to positive assessment model errors, and
lags in detecting a directional change in the trend.

Following a commercial fishery closure from 2007 to 2013,
the CC stock reopened to commercial fisheries in 2014,
and small commercial roe fisheries occurred in 2014, 2015, and 2016.
A commercial SOK fishery operated yearly from 2014 to 2020,
however these removals are not included in the estimation of $U_t$. 
Commercial SOK fishery did not occur in Area 07 in 2020 due to COVID-19,
however did they successfully resume in 2021 (Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch)).

### Strait of Georgia

The estimated spawning biomass for the SoG stock
declined in 2019,
increased in 2020, and
declined in 2021.
Accordingly, the uncertainty associated with the last few years of spawning biomass
along with the forecast biomass `r paste0("$\\SB_{", assess_yr, "}$")`,
is quite large (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)d).
There was an increasing trend in estimated spawning biomass
from about 2010 to 2016, which coincided with
a decline in estimated natural mortality that began in the late 2000s
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)b).
The model estimates natural mortality has been increasing since 2016,
and has now reached a level last estimated in the late 1960s.
This coincides with large shifts in survey biomass in recent 5 years,
with the index declining from 2016 to 2017, 2018 to 2019, and 2020 to 2021.
The large uncertainty in both spawning biomass and natural mortality estimates
in `r assess_yr` may be in part a function of the declining trend
in the spawn index starting in 2016 following the increasing trend that began in 2010 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)a).
The model fits an averaged trajectory through the spawn index values of the 2010s
and is currently underfitting the survey data from 2014 though 2016 and 2020.
The model estimates above average recruitment in most years from 2010 to
`r assess_yr` (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)c),
with especially large positive deviations in 2019 and 2020
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)e).
The large uncertainty around estimated age-`r age_first` recruitment
in 2019 and 2020 was observed in the previous years' assessment and
remains apparent now that these age-2s are fully recruited to the fishing/sampling gear.
Analysis of surplus production shows that for the year between 2019 and 2020,
the SoG SAR is estimated to be in a high production, high biomass state,
followed by negative production for the year between 2020 and 2021
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)f).

Commercial fisheries have occurred annually in SoG since the early-1970s
(following the stock collapse of the late 1960s).
Since implementing the fixed cutoff HCR in 1986,
the effective harvest rate $U_t$ is estimated to fluctuate
above and below the `r target_hr*100`% target rate,
with median estimates distributed evenly above and below `r target_hr*100`%
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
The model estimates the median effective harvest rate exceeded 25% in 2006 and 2017.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "SoG")`

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The time series of estimated spawning biomass shows a decline from the late 1980s through to a historic low in the 2000s (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)d).
The low estimated spawning biomass persisted through the 2006 to 2012 period and has since slowly increased to a level similar to that estimated for 2000.
The model reconstruction of spawning biomass closely follows the trajectory of spawn index values (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a).
Historically high natural mortality rates occur in the late 2000s and have since declined, though show an increasing trend from 2015 to 2021 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)b).
Recruitment deviations have been negative (lower than predicted by the stock-recruit function) on average since about 2003 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)e), with the exception of 2015, 2020 and 2021.
The reduction in estimated natural mortality below historical high levels and absence of removals from a commercial fishery appear
to be sufficient to offset this below average recruitment of age-`r age_first` fish to support biomass growth.
The absence of a commercial fishery since 2005 means the realized harvest rate has been zero for the last 15 years (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
There is  modest evidence for an increase in biomass above the LRP over since 2016 and
production estimates for the year between 2019 and 2020, and 2020 and 2021 are positive (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)f).

Investigation of WCVI MCMC diagnostics revealed autocorrelation in the estimation of
fishery selectivity-at-50% ($\hat{a}_1$) 
and its standard deviation ($\hat{\gamma}_1$)
for the "other" fisheries category
(i.e., reduction, food and bait, as well as special use).
Autocorrelation in parameter estimation may indicate
bias in the posterior distribution or local minima. 
In this instance, autocorrelation likely resulting from
there being no new commercial fishery data since 2005. 
Running longer chains resulted in only minor improvements.
If and when fisheries resume in future years,
the addition of new fishery data may reduce this apparent autocorrelation and
any resulting bias.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "WCVI")`

## Management performance

Management procedure performance can be investigated using time series of effective harvest rate.
The estimated effective harvest rate $U$ in each year $t$, calculated as
$U_t = C_t/(C_t + \SB_t)$, where
$C_t$ is catch in year $t$, and
$\SB_t$ is estimated spawning biomass in year $t$.
Time series of $U_t$ relative to target harvest rate of `r target_hr*100`% are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate).

## Application of MPs and harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`\label{sec:harv-opts}

<!--Generally, harvest advice for the major stocks of Pacific Herring has been based on a 1-year forecast of pre-fishery spawning biomass and
application of a HCR that is a hybrid of fixed escapement and a target harvest rate (e.g., @hall1988).
Although the target harvest rate has varied among regions in recent years (e.g., CC and PRD SARs; @dfo2017),
the “historical” practice was to apply a target harvest rate of `r target_hr*100`%
when the forecast is estimated to be above a fixed commercial fishery cutoff of
$0.25\SB_0$ defined in the 1996 stock assessment [@dfo2016].
This rule is referred to as the "fixed cutoff rule."

Renewal of the Pacific Herring management framework included a commitment to MSE simulation-evaluation of the performance of historical fixed cutoff and
alternative MPs in relation to conservation and fisheries management objectives.
The first cycle of the MSE process was completed for the WCVI and SoG SARs in 2018 [@dfo2019a];
a similar process was used to evaluate harvest strategies for HG, PRD, and CC in 2019 [@dfo2019c].
In the summer of 2020 the second MSE cycle was initiated 
for the WCVI and SoG management areas.
In this cycle updates included conditioning the OMs with more recent stock
and fishery data and evaluating the performance of additional candidate MPs for these management areas. 

The ranking of objectives and selection of MPs that meet objectives using MSE is an iterative process.
The first cycle of Pacific Herring MSE includes, as a starting point, four core fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c] which reflect DFO policy, and were applied to each major SAR:

1. Maintain spawning biomass above the LRP with at least 75% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t > 0.3\SB_0) \geq 0.75$),

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% probability over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., achieve a target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.6\SB_0) \geq 0.5$),

1. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25% over three Pacific Herring generations
(goal reflecting catch variability; $\text{AAV} < 0.25$), and

1. Maximize average annual catch over three Pacific Herring generations
(goal reflecting catch biomass).

However, a fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed for each management area.
DFO will continue to collaborate with coastal First Nations to develop area-specific objectives specific to Food, Social and Ceremonial fisheries as well as spawn-on-kelp (SOK) fisheries.
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with the herring industry, government, and non-government organizations
to describe broader objectives related to conservation, economics, and access.

The MPs for each SAR differ in the form of the HCR and choices of catch cap, but use the same monitoring data and assessment model [e.g., @cleary2018].
The current assessment model assumes natural mortality is time-varying.
The first MSE cycle introduced three hypotheses about future Pacific Herring natural mortality $M$: 

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-dependent process (DDM),

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-independent process (DIM), and

1. $M$ is constant over time (conM).

These three hypotheses are captured as three operating model (OM) scenarios in @dfo2019a.
The DDM scenario was identified as the Reference OM scenario based on discussion at the July 2018 CSAS review process [@dfo2019c],
while the DIM and conM scenarios were identified as Robustness OM scenarios.
There is however currently no scientifically supported method for predicting the natural mortality and therefore all three scenarios are included. 

Results presented here represent all three OM scenarios.

Several lessons were learned from the analysis:

1. The catch-at-age stock assessment model can produce large (positive) assessment errors.
Such assessment errors cause over-estimation of spawning biomass and
result in recommended catch limits such that the realized harvest rate exceeds the intended target specified by a HCR (e.g., over-harvest).

1. Reduction in harvest rate from 20% to 10% was the most effective means of mitigating stock assessment errors by reducing the absolute size of the catch.
The use of a catch cap, implemented as a maximum annual catch level, was an effective model-free way to further mitigate assessment errors at very high biomass levels.
Simulation analyses additionally showed that outcomes are insensitive to the choice of operational control points (OCPs) in the HCR when a low harvest rate (HR) and catch cap are applied.
This occurs because low biomass levels (associated with the lower OCP) are avoided for these management procedures (MPs).

1. Differences in specification of Pacific Herring MPs, including the HCR components, are expected a priori among SARs.
The reasons relate to differences in objectives deemed important by resource users,
differences in historical and current stock and fishery dynamics, and
differences in the magnitude and direction of assessment model errors in each SAR.
Conservation objectives such as those based on avoiding a threshold to serious harm (i.e., a limit reference point) in alignment with the DFO PA Framework [@dfo2009] are held constant among SARs based on the analyses of @kronlund2017.-->

Harvest options for `r assess_yr+1` reflect application of simulation-tested MPs
for each major SAR. 
MPs included for SoG and WCVI combines information from
the first MSE cycle [@dfo2019a] with
updated MP evaluations conducted in September 2020 [@dfo2021b].
MPs included for PRD and CC combines information from
the first MSE cycle for northern SARs [@dfo2019c] with
updated MP evaluations conducted in the summer of 2021 (this document).
Finally, science advice in 2018 recommended
discontinuing the use of the historical fixed cutoff HCR [@dfo2019a];
as such this MP has been removed from further consideration
for all Pacific Herring SARs.
Finally, MPs are not provided for HG due to requirements
for a rebuilding plan (detailed below).

### Haida Gwaii

The HG stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state
from approximately 2000 to 2018.
The stock was below the LRP for much of that period and shows
little evidence of sustained stock growth despite the absence of
commercial fisheries since 2002 (and since 2004 for the SOK fishery).
Survey biomass increased in 2019 and 2020, however
biomass estimates are highly uncertain given persistent high natural mortality.
Results of the simulation-evaluations found that none of the proposed MPs, 
including the historical and no fishing MPs,
performed satisfactorily against the conservation objective of
maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability
(i.e., at least 75%).\footnote{\label{fn:HighProb}``High'' probability is defined as 75 to 95\% by the DFO Decision-making framework (DFO 2009).}
<!-- TODO: automate the citation in the footnote (\citep{dfo2009}) -->

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "HG")`

DFO has committed to developing and implementing a rebuilding plan for
Haida Gwaii Pacific Herring by the end of fiscal year 2020/21.[^RebuildHG]
Work finalizing the draft for consultation continues via a 
technical working group comprised of members of
the Council of Haida Nation, DFO, and Parks Canada.
The consultation period is anticipated to commence in fall 2021.
Guidance for the
"Development of Rebuilding Plans under the Precautionary Approach Framework:
Growing Stocks out of the Critical Zone" [@dfo2013] states that
the primary objective of any rebuilding plan is to
promote stock growth out of the Critical Zone
(i.e., to grow the stock above the status-based LRP) by
ensuring removals from all fishing sources are kept to the lowest possible level
until the stock has cleared this zone with high probability.
Stock rebuilding does not end having met this goal, however, and
one of the goals of the rebuilding plan will be to
identify candidate threshold biomass levels greater than the LRP
that are consistent with a rebuilt state.

[^RebuildHG]: In response to recommendations in the
Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) October 2016
Report 2 - Sustaining Canada’s Major Fish Stocks - Fisheries and Oceans Canada,
the Department will develop rebuilding plans for major fish stocks that are
in the precautionary approach critical zone,
including Haida Gwaii Pacific Herring by the end of fiscal year 2020/21.

Based on MP evaluations and the ongoing rebuilding plan process,
the harvest recommendation for the HG stock in `r assess_yr + 1` is 0&nbsp;t.
Because Haida Gwaii has an on-going rebuilding plan process,
we did not update the HG OM with recent data
(as we did for PRD and CC; see below).

### Prince Rupert District

The PRD estimated stock biomass has shown little trend from 2005 to 2018,
with a modest increase from 2019 to 2021.

In summer 2021, we updated the PRD OM using data from 2019 and 2020.
That is, we updated the MSE operating model conditioning to include
spawn, catch, and biological data for 2019 and 2020, and we
re-ran MSE simulations to generate updated probability values for the MPs
presented in September 2019 [@dfo2020a] and 2020 [@dfo2021].
The updated closed-loop feedback simulations for PRD show that
MPs with harvest rates at 5, 10, and 20% maintain spawning biomass
above the LRP with 78 to 100% probability, over all three OM scenarios
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd)). 
No new MPs or objectives were included.

While MPs with harvest rates ranging from 5% to 20%
were are able to meet core conservation objective of
maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability
(i.e., at least 75%)^\ref{fn:HighProb}^,
they also imply different trade-offs among biomass (e.g., ecosystem)
and yield outcomes.
For management regions where multiple MPs meet the conservation objective,
further ranking of the remaining objectives is needed
in order to provide decision makers with a tractable set of trade-off choices.
However this was not undertaken because a fully specified set of objectives
has not yet been developed for each management area.

Effective harvest rates for the past 10 years (with positive catches)
average ~12% (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)),
during which the stock showed no sign of growth before 2018 and
is estimated to fluctuate at or near the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)d). 
Spawning biomass depletion increased above $0.3\SB_0$ in 2019 and
remained above in 2020 and 2021.
Although there is not evidence of a low biomass and low productivity state
for PRD in the past 30-years, adjacent SARs (HG and CC)
show evidence of recent prolonged periods of low biomass and low productivity:
states that were entered rapidly and were preceded by high biomass levels
[@kronlund2017].

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "PRD")`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs,
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd),
and include probability values that reflect new OM conditioning.
Harvest options listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd) reflect
application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1` forecast biomass for PRD,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective with a minimum 75% probability
under the Reference OM (i.e., DDM) scenario.
Harvest options under the two Robustness OM scenarios are also included.
For ease of comparison with MSE cycle 1 [@dfo2019c],
all MPs and scenarios listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd)
include performance metrics for the four core objectives.

### Central Coast

The CC stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from
approximately 2005 to 2014.
An increasing trend has been observed in recent years,
and overall the stock shows more volatility
(i.e., large increases/decreases in spawn abundance;
Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a) than was observed prior to 2005.

Similar to PRD, we updated the CC OM in summer 2021 using data from 2019 and 2020.
That is, we updated the MSE operating model conditioning to include
spawn, catch, and biological data for 2019 and 2020, and we
re-ran MSE simulations to generate updated probability values for the MPs
presented in September 2019 [@dfo2020a] and 2020 [@dfo2021].
The updated closed-loop feedback simulations for CC show that MPs
with harvest rates at 5 and 10% maintain spawning biomass
above the LRP with 84 to 100% probability over all three OM scenarios
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc)). 
No new MPs or objectives were included.

Simulation results for CC indicate 
there are multiple MPs that meet the conservation objective of
maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability
(at least 75%)^\ref{fn:HighProb}^.
For management regions where multiple MPs meet the conservation objective,
further ranking of the remaining objectives is needed in order to
provide decision makers with a tractable set of trade-off choices.
However this was not undertaken with the first MSE cycle because
a fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed
for each management area.

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "CC")`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs,
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc),
and include probability values that reflect new OM conditioning.
Harvest options under the two Robustness OM scenarios are also included.
For ease of comparison with MSE cycle 1 [@dfo2019c],
all MPs and scenarios listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc) include
performance metrics for the four core objectives.

Additionally, DFO acknowledges commitment to the Heiltsuk Nation for
the development of a Joint Fisheries Management Plan for Pacific Herring
in the Central Coast in `r assess_yr + 1`.
Results presented here may inform this on going commitment.

### Strait of Georgia

In 2018, closed-loop feedback simulations for the SoG showed that all tested MPs could maintain the spawning biomass above the LRP with 91% probability or higher across all OM scenarios. 

Additional simulation-evaluations were conducted in 2019 to further explore the role of catch caps in mitigating assessment errors [@dfo2019c].
A comparison of catch caps from 30,000&nbsp;t to 5,000&nbsp;t showed no discernible gain in conservation performance under all 3 OM scenarios.
Results also showed MPs with catch caps of 20,000&nbsp;t or less rarely exceed the 20% harvest rate for any given projection year (over the 15 year projections).

In September 2020, the SoG OM was updated to include spawn survey data
from 2018 to 2020 and biological data for 2018 and 2019 [@dfo2021b].
The updated closed-loop feedback simulations for the SoG show that MPs
with harvest rates at 10, 15, and 20% maintain the spawning biomass
above the LRP with 75 to 85% probability over all three OM scenarios
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-sog)). 
MPs with harvest rate of 30% did not meet the conservation objective
($p$=69% for the Reference OM).

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "SoG")`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs,
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-sog).
These options reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1`
forecast biomass for SoG,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective with a minimum
75% probability under the Reference OM (DDM) scenario.
Harvest options under the two Robustness OM scenarios are also included.
All MPs and scenarios listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-sog) include
updated performance metrics for the four core objectives
under all three scenarios [@dfo2021b].

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The WCVI stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from
approximately 2004 to 2014.
An increasing trend has been observed in recent years,
with biomass remaining low relative to historical levels,
trending around the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$.

In 2018, closed-loop feedback simulations for the WCVI showed
the conservation objective could be met under the Reference OM scenario
with between 75 and 87% probability,
but that these MPs failed to meet the conservation objective under the DIM
Robustness OM scenario, where natural mortality rates are
most similar to the last 10 years ($p=56$ to 74%).

In September 2020, the WCVI OM was updated to include
spawn survey data and biological data from 2018 to 2019 [@dfo2021b].
The updated closed-loop feedback simulations for the WCVI show that
MPs with harvest rates of 5, 10, and 15% maintained spawning biomass
above the LRP with between 81 and 93% probability,
over all three OM scenarios (Table \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi)). 
Improved MP performance in the 2020 update for WCVI,
relative to the first WCVI MSE cycle, 
is due to an increased spawn index in 2018 and 2019 and
increased status relative to $SB_0$. 
Performance improvement is observed under all three scenarios.

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "WCVI")`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs,
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi).
These options reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1`
forecast biomass for WCVI,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective with a minimum
75% probability under the Reference OM (DDM) scenario.
Harvest options under the two Robustness OM scenarios are also included.
All MPs and scenarios listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi) include
updated performance metrics for the four core objectives
under all three scenarios [@dfo2021b].
