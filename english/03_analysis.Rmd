# Analysis and Response

## Management strategy evaluation\label{sec:mse}

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has committed to
renewing the current management framework to address a range of challenges
facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in BC. 
Renewal of the management framework for Pacific Herring uses MSE to
evaluate the performance of candidate MPs against
hypotheses about past and future stock and fishery dynamics. 
The purpose of the MSE process is to
identify and eliminate MPs that incur unacceptable risks to a stock
(i.e., poor choices) and
identify MPs that provide acceptable outcomes
related to conservation and fishery management objectives.
Identifying preferred MPs requires
a fully specified set of measurable objectives that include
reference points (typically categorized as limits and targets) and
to the extent possible,
specification of measurable objectives related to
catch, catch variability, and socio-cultural goals. 
MSE is an iterative and ongoing process conducted with the participation of
First Nations, the fishing industry, as well as
government and non-government organizations. 

The first MSE cycles for the SoG and WCVI SARs
were completed in 2018 [@dfo2019a].
Steps included
OM development [@benson2022],
fitting OMs to Pacific Herring stock and fishery monitoring data
from `r major_start_yr` to 2017, and
closed-loop simulations of MP performance for
alternative future natural mortality scenarios [@dfo2019a].
In 2019, the MSE process was extended to
the HG, PRD, and CC SARs
with stock and fishery monitoring data updated to include 2018
and performance evaluation of SAR specific MPs [@dfo2019c],
with subsequent updates outlined in Section "\nameref{sec:context}".
Management procedure evaluation tables were updated in 2022
[@dfo2022b].

Currently, a core set of fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c]
have been applied to each major SAR:

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the LRP with at least 75% probability
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.3 \SB_0) \geq 0.75$),
where generation time is estimated to be about five years [@cleary2010].

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% probability 
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., achieve a target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq \SB_{targ}) \geq 0.50$).

1. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25%
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., minimize catch variability; $\text{AAV} < 0.25$).

1. Maximize average annual catch
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., maximize average catch).

However, a fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed
for each SAR.
DFO will continue to collaborate with coastal First Nations to
develop area-specific objectives specific to
FSC fisheries as well as SOK fisheries.
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with
the herring industry, government, and non-government organizations
to describe broader objectives related to conservation, economics, and access.

MPs for each SAR differ in the form of the harvest control rule (HCR)
and choice of catch cap,
but use the same type of monitoring data and assessment model
[e.g., @cleary2018].
The current stock assessment model
assumes natural mortality $M$ is time-varying and
this is reflected in the MSE as
two hypotheses about future Pacific Herring natural mortality: 

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-dependent process (DDM), and

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-independent process (DIM).

These two hypotheses are captured as operating model (OM) scenarios
in @benson2022.
The DDM scenario was identified as the reference OM scenario based on
discussion at the 2018 CSAS review process [@dfo2019c],
while the DIM scenario was identified as a robustness OM scenario.

On June 26-28, 2023, a regional peer review occurred for "Application 
of a new modelling framework for the assessment of Pacific Herring 
(*Clupea pallasii*) major stocks and implementation in the MSE process."
The details of the review process are summarized in @dfo2023a, and
there were two key recommendations for implementation:

1. A process for implementing the new assessment and operating model, 
updates to the MSE, and identification of exceptional circumstances 
should be developed in a phased approach in consultation with managers, 
First Nations and other stakeholders.

1. A minimum three year cycle for MSE updates is recommended, 
unless new evidence reveals exceptional circumstances.

DFO is committed to implementing these recommendations
prior to implementing the
spatially integrated statistical catch at age herring (SISCAH)
modelling framework.

1. Differences in specification of Pacific Herring MPs,
including HCR components, are expected a priori among SARs.
The reasons relate to
differences in objectives deemed important by resource users,
differences in historic and current stock and fishery dynamics, and
differences in the magnitude and direction of assessment model errors.
Conservation objectives are held constant among SARs
based on the analyses of @kronlund2017 
(e.g., avoid a biological limit reference point (LRP)
in alignment with the DFO precautionary approach (PA) Policy [@dfo2009]).

1. There are many possible ways to incorporate MP performance in
robustness trials into decision making,
but there is currently no accepted scientific way to
combine results from multiple operating models.

1. In situations where multiple MPs meet the agreed upon objectives,
further criteria, such as ranking secondary objectives,
is needed in order to provide decision-makers
with a tractable set of trade-off choices.

1. Outcomes of MP evaluations appear to be more heavily influenced by
the last three to five years of stock status and 
natural mortality trends used to condition the OM. 
If simulations were run over a greater number of years (e.g., 50 years)
performance would start to approach equilibrium and be 
unaffected by most recent trends in OM conditioning data.
This phenomenon is important to consider when selecting or eliminating MPs, 
especially if probabilities are considerably different between MP updates.

## Input data

There are three types of input data used for
the Pacific Herring stock assessment:
catch data, biological data, and abundance data.
These data are described in the following sections, and
summarized in Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Relative to the previous assessment,
the only change to input data was to extend all the time series
to include the `r this_season` herring season (July 1 to June 30).
Note that we refer to 'year' instead of 'herring season' in this report;
therefore `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season` Pacific Herring season.

### Catch data

For the purposes of stock assessment,
catch data are summarized by gear type as described in
Table \@ref(tab:data-input) and presented in Figure \@ref(fig:major-catch).
As in previous years, catch data for the stock assessment model
does not include mortality from the commercial SOK fishery,
nor any recreational fisheries or food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) harvest.
Recreational fisheries and FSC harvest are considered minor
relative to commercial harvest.
The commercial SOK fishery is licensed based on pounds of validated SOK product
(i.e., eggs adhered to kelp), not tonnes of fish used or spawned.
Currently there is no basis to validate mortality
imposed on the population by this fishery, however
methods for estimating SOK mortality have been developed within
the SISCAH modelling framework [@dfo2023a].

Combined commercial removals from `r assess_yr - num_yrs_tab` to `r assess_yr`
from the roe, food and bait, and special use fisheries
appear in Table \@ref(tab:annual-catch).
Total SOK harvest (i.e., pounds of validated product) for the major SARs
from `r assess_yr - num_yrs_tab` to `r assess_yr` is presented in
Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch).

### Biological data\label{sec:biol-data}

Biological samples are collected as described in
@cleary2018 and Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Biological data inputs to the stock assessment are
annual weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-wa)) and 
annual number-at-age, shown as proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-pa)).

Declines in weight-at-age are evident for all major SARs
from the mid-1980s to 2010.
Declining weight-at-age may be due to a number of factors, including
fishing effects (i.e., gear selectivity),
environmental effects (e.g., changes in ocean productivity), or
changes in sampling protocols
(e.g., shorter time frame over which samples are collected).
Declines in weight-at-age appear to have ceased since 2010.

### Abundance data

The spawn index survey collects information on
spatial extent of the spawn, number of egg layers,
substrate type, and other data.
There are two spawn survey periods defined by the predominant survey method:
surface survey period from `r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1` and
dive survey period from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`.
Data from these surveys are used to calculate egg density in each spawn.
Ultimately, we calculate the 'spawn index', 
the estimated biomass of mature spawners required to produce those eggs.
The `r surv_yr_rng[2]` spawn survey followed standard dive survey protocols
for the HG, PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI SARs as described in @cleary2018.
Time series of spawn index by major SAR
from `r paste(surv_yr_rng, collapse=" to ")`
are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index)
and Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) to \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi).

## Spatial spawn distribution

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) through \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) 
summarize the spatial distribution of survey spawn biomass
(i.e., the spawn index)
by proportion over the last `r num_yrs_tab + 1` years for the major SARs.
HG spawn is summarized by Group, while
spawn in PRD, CC, and WCVI are summarized by Statistical Area;
the choice of spatial grouping reflects spawning behaviour and
biology for each SAR based on the
survey data and working group discussions with local First Nations.

## Stock status update

Analyses of stock trend information is presented following
methods of @cleary2018 for the Pacific Herring major SARs.
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs
have a chain length of `r number_to_word(mcmc_length)`
with a sample taken every `r number_to_word(mcmc_samp_freq)`
iterations (i.e., thinning).
Then the first `r number_to_word(mcmc_burnin)` samples are discarded
(i.e., burn-in),
leaving `r number_to_word(mcmc_num_samples)` samples as posteriors.
Perceptions of stock status based on outputs (i.e., posteriors)
from SCA models are summarized for each SAR
in a six-panel figure (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)).
The panels show:

a. Model fit to scaled spawn survey data,

a. Instantaneous natural mortality rate $M$ estimates,

a. Number of age-`r age_first` recruits,

a. Spawning biomass $\SB_t$ and total catch $C_t$,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$,

a. Recruitment deviations (log scale) from the
Beverton-Holt recruitment function, and

a. Spawning biomass production $P_t = \SB_{t+1} - \SB_t + C_{t+1}$
for the dive survey period,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$.

Note that spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index) is scaled to abundance
in panel (a) by the spawn survey scaling parameter $q$.
The spawn index has two distinct periods defined by the dominant survey method: 
surface surveys (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`) and 
dive surveys (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`).
Thus, two $q$ parameters are implemented in the estimation procedure:
$q_1$ (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`)
with an uninformative prior, and
$q_2$ (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`)
with an informative prior approximating 1.0.

The surface survey methodology has been used on occasion
from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`. 
Generally this occurs when spawns are observed in locations where
a dive survey team is not available, or
when spawns are early (e.g., January or February) or
late (e.g., May) in the season. 
In these instances,
spawning biomass estimates obtained from surface surveys for
a given SAR and year are added to biomass estimates from dive surveys,
and $q_2 = 1$ is assumed for the combined index.
The \link{https://github.com/grinnellm/Reports}{Pacific Herring data summaries}
show the proportion of spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index)
from the surface and dive survey methods by SAR and year.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only surface surveys were conducted
for HG in 2020 and 2021, as well as for PRD in 2020.
These surface survey observations are treated as dive survey observations and
are assumed to be continuous with the dive survey time series.
Methods for combining surface and dive survey observations are presented
for the SISCAH modelling framework [@dfo2023a], but are not implemented here.

### Reference points\label{sec:ref-pts}

A biological LRP is defined for the major
Pacific Herring SARs at $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017].
Candidate USRs were introduced in @cleary2018 and
implemented as biomass objectives in simulation analyses
for WCVI and SoG in 2018 [@dfo2019a], and
then for HG, PRD, and CC in 2019 [@dfo2019c].
An analysis of USR options was undertaken in 2022 with
results presented in @dfo2022a.
In total, five USR options were evaluated:

1. Average spawning biomass during a productive period
$\overline{\SB}_\mli{Prod}$
(i.e., a $B_\text{MSY}$ proxy; Table \@ref(tab:prod-period)),

1. $0.4\SB_0$,

1. $0.5\SB_0$,

1. $0.6\SB_0$, and

1. Average spawning biomass from `r major_start_yr` to `r assess_yr`
$\overline{\SB}$.

Implementing USRs as target biomass objectives within
the simulation-evaluation process allows evaluation of
MPs with respect to achieving USRs, 
including whether a given USR option can be achieved in the absence of 
commercial fisheries. 
In 2023, DFO Resource Management selected and implemented a provisional 
USR of $\overline{\SB}$ through 2022/23 IFMP process.
Stock status relative to assessment model estimates $0.3\SB_0$ (i.e., LRP) and
USR options are presented for PRD, CC, and WCVI SARs
(Tables \@ref(tab:ref-points-prd) through \@ref(tab:ref-points-wcvi)).

LRPs and USRs relate stock status to the DFO PA Policy [@dfo2009], and
the same calculations are used for each Pacific Herring SAR.
There is an important distinction between reference points (e.g., LRP, USR) and
operational control points (OCPs) of the HCR
or the management procedure (MP) used to set catch limits.
Specifically, OCPs define the inflection points of a HCR and
identify biomass levels where management action is taken,
whereas LRPs and USRs are management objectives.

### Coast wide trends

Coast wide trends in Pacific Herring biomass show 
an average increasing trend in estimated spawning biomass
from 2010 to 2020 with
stable catches since 1980, and catch declining over the last decade 
(Figure \@ref(fig:coastwide-biomass-catch)).
Comparisons of total estimated biomass and spawning biomass
are also included for each SAR
(Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-total-biomass));
these trends are presented using median posterior estimates.

### Haida Gwaii

Estimated spawning biomass historic lows occurred in the late 1960s predicated
by high catches, low estimated recruitment and high estimated natural mortality 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)a, b, e). 
Under variable estimated recruitment, estimated spawning biomass recovered
from that point through the early 1980s supported by 
declining rates of estimated natural mortality.
As estimated natural mortality began increasing again in the mid 1990s,
estimated biomass declined. 
A reprieve in estimated low biomass occurred following several years with 
above average estimated recruitment through the late 1990s,
before biomass declined to persistent historic lows 
from 2000 to present, with a couple of low biomass peaks in 2013 and 2019
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)d).
The increasing trend in the estimated natural mortality rate since 1980
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)b) largely absorbed  any surplus production
attributed to above average recruitment events
(e.g., 1997, 2012, 2018; Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)c, d).
Additionally estimated natural mortality has increased the last 5 years
to historic highs.  

The HG stock persists in a low biomass state,
with many years also showing low productivity
which has largely precluded stock growth (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)f).
Above-average recruitment of age-`r age_first` fish in 2018, 
leading to increases in survey biomass in 2019 and 2020 were positive signs but 
average to below-average recruitment since then,
which estimates negative productivity,
has brought biomass down to recent historical lows. 
The effective harvest rate $U_t$ since 2000 has been at or near zero
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)),
with the last commercial roe fishery in 2002,
and the last commercial SOK fishery in 2004.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "HG", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`
Management measures to support long-term recovery of herring stocks in
Haida Gwaii are being developed through
the rebuilding plan process.$^{\ref{fn:rebuild}}$

### Prince Rupert District

Estimated spawning biomass reached historic highs in the early 1960s 
due to low estimated mortality rate and high estimated recruitment
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)a, b, e). 
This was followed immediately by below average recruitment and
a rise to the highest estimated mortality rate,
more than doubling within 10 years.
In response the stock collapsed by the mid-1960s to
the lowest estimated spawning biomass. 
Spawning biomass recovered by the mid-1980s estimated to be
about 50% of the historic high
even amid mostly below-average recruitment
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)b, d, e).
In the late-1980s,
estimated spawning biomass began a steady decline
amid slowly rising mortality rates and variable recruitment,
before stabilizing at a relatively low level
(but above historic lows) between 2005 and 2018.
Since then estimated spawning biomass has shown modest increases in biomass 
with above average age-`r age_first` recruitment in 2014, 2018 and,
2022 and stable natural mortality rates
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)c, d, f). 
Productivity in recent years is relatively high compared to the 
last 30 years, with the highest estimated productivity in 2022
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)f).

Fluctuations in spawning biomass trend appear to be less than in other SARs 
in the last 30 years, possibly because they are smaller in magnitude 
and offset each other as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)a.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "PRD", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`
Commercial fisheries have occurred annually in PRD since the mid-1980s,
with the exception of 2019 to 2022,
during which the effective harvest rate $U_t$ was estimated to be
at or below 20% in all years except 1989 (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).

### Central Coast

Estimated spawning biomass reached a historic high around 1980
following low estimated natural mortality rates and the highest estimated 
recruitment in 1979 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a, b, c). 
From there a decline in estimated spawning biomass
appears to be influenced initially by 
higher estimated natural mortality rates and
highly variable estimated recruitment.
Spawning biomass trend declined from 1985-2005 and 
an increase in estimated natural mortality led to
historically low estimated biomass levels from 2005 to 2015. 
Decreasing estimated natural mortality lead to moderate increases in 
biomass through 2020. 
In 2021 - 2023, increasing estimated natural mortality caused a decrease 
in estimated biomass, which was mitigated in part by higher than average 
estimated recruitment in 2022 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a, b, e).
Model estimates suggest slightly less spawning biomass in 2023 than 2022
(Table \@ref(tab:cc-spawning-biomass-depletion)),
and the analysis of surplus production shows
evidence of positive production in 2018, 
followed by negative in both 2019 and 2020, 
and near neutral production in 2021 and 2022 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)f).

An examination of spawn biomass by herring section shows
the recent decline in herring spawn to have largely occurred in
Spiller Channel (Sections 072 and 078),
Kitasu Bay/East Higgins (Section 067) and
Thompson/Stryker (Section 074; Figure \@ref(fig:spawn-section-cc)).
Occurrence of spawn in Thompson/Stryker in 2020 to 2021
represented the first significant spawns in this section in many years.
The mechanisms driving spawn fluctuations in the Central Coast
are not well understood.

From 1990 to 2006 the effective harvest rate $U_t$ is estimated to fluctuate
above and below `r target_hr*100`%,
with median estimates exceeding `r target_hr*100`% in some of these years
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
Occurrences of $U_t$ exceeding `r target_hr*100`% 
are due in part to positive assessment model errors and
lags in detecting a directional change in the trend.

Following a commercial fishery closure from 2007 to 2013,
the CC SAR was reopened to commercial fisheries;
commercial roe fisheries occurred in 2014, 2015, and 2016.
Commercial SOK fisheries have operated yearly at some level 
from 2014 to 2021 and in 2023 (Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch)). 
Note that a commercial SOK fishery did not occur in Area 07 in 2020
due to COVID-19,
and no commercial SOK fisheries were permitted in 2022.
SOK removals are not included in the estimation of $U_t$. 

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "CC", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The time series of estimated spawning biomass reached an estimated peak in the 
mid to late 1970s during a time period of lowest
observed model estimates of natural mortality and variable estimated recruitment
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a, b, c). 
From the late 1980s through to around 2008
a variable increase in estimated mortality and
a generally variable but low estimated recruitment led to a declining trend,
down from the peaks observed in the late 1970s 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a, b, c).

The low estimated spawning biomass persisted from 2006 to 2012, 
influenced by negative recruitment deviations 
(i.e., lower than predicted by the stock-recruit function)
and the highest estimated natural mortality rates since `r major_start_yr`
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a, b, f).
Some increases in estimated biomass occured in 2015 with 
lower estimated natural mortality and higher estimated recruitment, 
and then again after 2020 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)d, f).

The absence of a commercial fishery since 2005 means the realized harvest rate
has been zero for the last 15 years (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
There is modest evidence for an increase in biomass above the LRP since 2016 and
positive production estimates in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)f).

Investigation of WCVI MCMC diagnostics revealed autocorrelation
in the estimation of fishery selectivity-at-50% ($\hat{a}_1$) 
and its standard deviation ($\hat{\gamma}_1$)
for the "other" fisheries category
(i.e., reduction, food and bait, as well as special use).
Autocorrelation in parameter estimation may indicate
bias in the posterior distribution or local minima. 
In this instance, autocorrelation is likely resulting from little
to no catch or age composition data for that fishery in the 1970s. 
In an attempt to resolve parameter autocorrelation, we removed
age compositions from 1984 for which there was no associated catch as well as
catch from 1978 to 1996 (range: 0 t to 0.84 t), for which
there are no associated age compositions. 
These changes did not notably improve the autocorrelation.
Similarly, running longer chains (20 million vs 5 million)
resulted in only minor improvements (as was observed when this was conducted
in 2021 [@dfo2021c]).

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "WCVI", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`

## Management performance

Historic management procedure performance can be assessed using
the time series of effective harvest rate $U$.
Estimated effective harvest rate $U$ in each year $t$ is
$U_t = C_t/(C_t + \SB_t)$, where
$C_t$ is catch in year $t$, and
$\SB_t$ is estimated spawning biomass in year $t$.
Time series of $U_t$
are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate).

## Application of MPs and harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`\label{sec:harv-opts}

Harvest options for `r assess_yr+1` reflect
application of simulation-tested MPs for the major SARs,
derived from the Herring OM [@benson2022]. 
OM conditioning was updated in 2022 using historic stock and fishery data
from `r major_start_yr` to 2021; no MP updates were conducted for 2023.
MPs are not provided for HG because this is now conducted within the
HG rebuilding plan process.$^{\ref{fn:rebuild}}$
MPs for SoG are provided in @dfo2025b.

### Haida Gwaii

The HG stock  persisted in a low biomass state
from approximately 2000-2018 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)).
The stock was below the LRP for much of that period and shows
little evidence of sustained stock growth despite the absence of
commercial fisheries since 2002 (and since 2004 for the SOK fishery).
Survey biomass increased from 2019 to 2020,
remained stable in 2021,
and declined from 2021 to 2023.
Results of the simulation-evaluations found that none of the proposed MPs, 
including the historical and no fishing MPs,
maintained spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability
[i.e., at least 75%, @dfo2009].\footnote{\label{fn:HighProb}``High'' probability
is defined as 75 to 95\% by the DFO decision-making framework (DFO 2009).}

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "HG", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

DFO has committed to developing and implementing a rebuilding plan for
Haida Gwaii Pacific Herring.
A technical working group comprised of members of
the Council of Haida Nation, DFO, and Parks Canada co-developed
a draft plan for which a  consultation period was held
from September 26 to December 16, 2022. 
Approval of the final rebuilding plan is expected for the fall/winter of 2023.

Guidance for developing rebuilding plans [@dfo2013] states that
the primary objective of any rebuilding plan is to
promote stock growth out of the Critical Zone
(i.e., to grow the stock above the status-based LRP) by
ensuring removals from all fishing sources are kept to the lowest possible level
until the stock has cleared this zone with high probability.
However, stock rebuilding does not end having met this goal, and
one of the goals of the rebuilding plan will be to
identify candidate threshold biomass levels greater than the LRP
that are consistent with a rebuilt state.

Based on MP evaluations and the ongoing rebuilding plan process,
the harvest recommendation for the Haida Gwaii stock in
`r assess_yr + 1` is 0&nbsp;t.
All future MP evaluations will occur through the rebuilding plan process.

### Prince Rupert District

The PRD estimated stock biomass showed little trend from 2005 to 2018, 
fluctuating at or near the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)d). 
Spawning biomass increased above $0.3\SB_0$ in 2019 and has
remained above since.
Adjacent SARs (i.e., HG and CC)
show evidence of recent prolonged periods of low biomass and low productivity;
however these states were entered rapidly and were preceded by
high biomass levels [@kronlund2017].

In the summer of 2022, we updated the conditioning of the OM
for PRD with 2021 spawn, catch, and biological data.
We re-ran MSE simulations to generate updated probability values for MPs
presented in 2019 [@dfo2020a] and 2020 [@dfo2021a].
These latest MP evaluations also appear in @dfo2022a.
No new MPs were included,
however probability metrics for the five USRs options [@dfo2022a]
were estimated and have been added to the harvest options tables.
Updated closed-loop feedback simulations for PRD show that
MPs with harvest rates at 5, 10, and 20% maintain spawning biomass
above the LRP with 85 to 97% probability, over both OM scenarios
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd)). 
`r mean_harvest_text(SAR = "PRD", translate = french)`

While MPs with harvest rates ranging from 5% to 20%
were able to meet the core conservation objective of
maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability
(i.e., at least 75%)^\ref{fn:HighProb}^,
they also imply different trade-offs among biomass and yield objectives.
Since multiple MPs meet the conservation objective,
other socio-economic reasons may drive the choice for a particular MP.

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "PRD", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd)
and include probability values for the LRP and provisional USR which 
reflect updated OM conditioning.
Options reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1`
forecast biomass for PRD,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective with a minimum 75% probability
under both DDM and DIM OM scenarios.
For ease of comparison with MP performance evaluation, harvest options are 
presented along side MP performance metrics for both OM scenarios 
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd)).

### Central Coast

The CC stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from
approximately 2005 to 2014.
An increasing trend was observed from 2015-2020, followed by a decline 
from 2021-2023 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a).

In the summer of 2022, we updated the conditioning of the MSE operating model
for CC with 2021 spawn, catch, and biological data.
These latest MP evaluations also appear in @dfo2022a.
No new MPs were included,
however probability metrics for the five USRs options 
[@dfo2022a] were estimated and have been added to the harvest options tables.
The updated simulations show that MPs with harvest rates at 5% and 10% 
maintain spawning biomass above the LRP with 81 to 91% probability over all 
both OM scenarios (Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc)).
`r mean_harvest_text(SAR = "CC", translate = french)`

Harvest options listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc) reflect
application of MPs to the 2023 forecast biomass for CC,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective
with a minimum 75% probability under both DDM or DIM OM scenarios.

Since multiple MPs meet the conservation objective of
maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with at least 75%,
other socio-economic objectives may drive the choice for a particular MP. 
Additionally, the current CC OM is unable to directly address
Heilstuk Nation conservation objectives related to herring age and size, nor 
objectives on a finer spatial scale or those specific to SOK fisheries.
These limitations exist for all five major stocks.

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "CC", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

Finally, DFO acknowledges commitment to the Heiltsuk Nation for
the development of a Joint Fisheries Management Plan for Pacific Herring
in the Central Coast in `r assess_yr + 1`.
Results presented here may inform this ongoing commitment.

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The WCVI stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from
approximately 2004 to 2014.
In recent years, biomass remained low relative to historic levels,
but above the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$.

In 2022, with updated 2021 data, closed-loop feedback simulations
for WCVI show the conservation objective is met
under the DDM OM scenario with between 80 and 84% probability,
and the same MPs failed to meet the conservation objective under the DIM 
OM scenario, where natural mortality rates are
most similar to the last 10 years ($p=$ 61 to 65%).

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "WCVI", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs,
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi).
These options reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1`
forecast biomass for WCVI, under the two OM scenarios.
All MPs and scenarios listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi) include
updated performance metrics under both scenarios [@dfo2021b].

## Ecosystem considerations

The Pacific Herring assessment models environmental
variability implicitly via time varying natural mortality and recruitment
(e.g., implied predation and other environmental impacts);
however, ecosystem indicators are not directly incorporated into the
assessment model.
The assessment also does not necessarily identify
the mechanisms through which mortality is changing.
Qualitative and quantitative summaries and analyses
can help to fill this knowledge gap.
As a step towards improving the understanding
of the environmental conditions that affect herring,
directed and standardized literature searches were conducted
to identify mechanistic hypotheses that link
environmental and biological pressures to Pacific Herring outcomes (responses),
such as distribution, growth, migration, productivity, reproduction, and
survival [@boldt2022].
For a case study on Haida Gwaii herring,
indicators of these mechanistically-linked pressures and responses
were assembled from multiple sources [e.g., @boldt2023], based on the
Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework [@elliott2002].
Indicators generally corresponded to published lists of standard indicators
(e.g., @bundy2017; @boldt2014; @takahashi2019),
with consideration for the spatial scales and herring distribution by season
and life history stage (Boldt et al.).\footnote{\label{fn:boldt}

A. Peña, and R.I. Perry.
Incorporating ecosystem information into science advice -
a case study for Haida Gwaii Pacific Herring. In prep.}
Data exploration and analyses
were undertaken to collate and reduce the number of indicators
according to the methods of @boldt2021 and
indicator selection criteria [@rice2005].
A multi-model approach,
including single pressure-response and multivariate models,
was applied to determine functional forms of
pressure-response relationships and identify linear
and non-linear relationships (Boldt et al.).$^{\ref{fn:boldt}}$

Environmental pressures that have been identified as important for herring
include the timing, duration, and magnitude of upwelling,
which can affect the amount of primary and secondary production
available to herring
[@mackas2001; @hourston2019]; Figure \@ref(fig:eco-diagram).
Other physical environmental pressures include sea surface temperature (SST),
salinity, sea level, river discharge, and Ekman transport
[@tester1948; @alderdice1985; @stocker1985; @stocker1988;
@schweigert1990; @ware1991; @zebdi1995].
For example, @tester1948 found that herring recruitment and survival are
negatively related to sea surface temperature.
Fish yield was found to be
correlated with phytoplankton and zooplankton production in BC [@ware2005]
and zooplankton biomass anomalies have been correlated
with herring growth [@mackas2007].
Changes in zooplankton species composition from larger-sized and lipid-rich
boreal and subarctic copepod species to smaller-sized and lipid-poor southern
copepod species affects the quality of food available to herring
[@mackas2001; @keister2011].
The timing or match-mismatch between spawning herring and the subsequent
availability of prey to juveniles appears to be important in determining
abundance of age-0 herring in the fall [@schweigert2013; @boldt2018].
Increased water temperatures are often associated with increased abundance of
herring predators and competitors [@mysak1986; @ware1986].
Herring predators, include Pacific Hake, groundfish (e.g., Spiny Dogfish),
Coho and Chinook Salmon, pinnipeds and Humpback Whales
[@ware1986; @ware1995; @schweigert2010].
Potential herring competitors include other zooplanktivores, such as
juvenile groundfish, juvenile pink, chum and sockeye salmon, Pacific Hake,
and, in the past, Pacific Sardine.
Spatio-temporal model results suggest that
the strongest drivers of summer distribution and biomass
of Pacific Herring off the WCVI include:
zooplankton prey availability, predator avoidance, particularly Pacific Hake,
and competition with sardines [@godefroid2019].

The Haida Gwaii herring stock has been in a low productivity phase
in  the absence of fishing over the last two decades.
The herring responses that have shown long-term declining trends are
herring biomass, age-3 weight, and condition.
Trends in pressures that correspond with these herring responses include
(Table \@ref(tab:eco-trend-desc) and Figure \@ref(fig:eco-trend)):

1. Long-term increasing SSTs,
which has been correlated with poor herring productivity.
In 2022, late and below average upwelling
indicate reduced upwelling-based productivity.

1. An increase in total zooplankton biomass and hence prey availability,
but with changes to the community composition
(i.e., lipid-poor southern copepods increased during and
then decreased after the 2014-2016 marine heat wave).

1. An increase in marine mammal predator abundances
(i.e., Steller Sea Lion and Humpback whale abundance).

1. Decreases in some groundfish predators and competitors
(i.e., Pacific Hake, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish biomass, Arrowtooth Flounder),
with recent (2021) increases in survey catch rates of some species
(e.g., Pacific Cod).
