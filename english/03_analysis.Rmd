# Analysis and response

## COVID-19 pandemic

Unlike the past two years,
the COVID-19 pandemic had a minor impact on
the collection and analysis of biological data in 2022.
Spawn surveys proceeded as usual in 2022,
with dive surveys in all major SARs.

## Management strategy evaluation\label{sec:mse}

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has committed to
renewing the current management framework to address a range of challenges
facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in BC. 
Renewal of the management framework for Pacific Herring uses MSE to
evaluate the performance of candidate MPs against
hypotheses about past and future stock and fishery dynamics. 
The purpose of the MSE process is to
identify and eliminate MPs that incur unacceptable risks to a stock
(i.e., poor choices) and
identify MPs that provide acceptable outcomes related to
conservation and fishery management objectives.
The identification of a preferred MP requires
a fully specified set of measurable objectives that include
reference points (typically categorized as limits and targets) and
to the extent possible,
specification of measurable objectives related to
catch, catch variability, and socio-cultural goals. 
MSE is an iterative and ongoing process conducted with the participation of
First Nations, the fishing industry, as well as
government and non-government organizations. 

The first MSE cycles for the SoG and WCVI SARs
were completed in 2018 [@dfo2019a].
Steps included
OM development [@benson2022],
fitting OMs to Pacific Herring stock and fishery monitoring data
from `r major_start_yr` to 2017, and
closed-loop simulations of MP performance for
alternative future natural mortality scenarios [@dfo2019a].
In 2019, the MSE process was extended to
the HG, PRD, and CC SARs
with stock and fishery monitoring data updated to include 2018
and performance evaluation of area specific MPs [@dfo2019c],
with subsequent updates outlined in Section "\nameref{sec:context}".
Results from MP evaluations reflect most recent updates for all SARs.

A core set of fisheries management objectives [@dfo2019c]
have been applied to each major SAR:

1. Maintain spawning biomass above the LRP with at least 75% probability
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., avoid a biomass limit; $P(\SB_t > 0.3\SB_0) \geq 0.75$),

1. Maintain spawning biomass at or above the USR with at least 50% probability 
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., achieve a target biomass; $P(\SB_t \geq 0.6\SB_0) \geq 0.5$),

1. Maintain average annual variability (AAV) in catch below 25%
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., minimize catch variability; $\text{AAV} < 0.25$), and

1. Maximize average annual catch
over three Pacific Herring generations
(i.e., maximize average catch).

However, a fully specified set of objectives has not yet been developed
for each SAR.
DFO will continue to collaborate with coastal First Nations to
develop area-specific objectives specific to
FSC fisheries as well as SOK fisheries.
In addition, DFO will continue to engage with
the herring industry, government, and non-government organizations
to describe broader objectives related to conservation, economics, and access.

MPs for each SAR differ in the form of the HCR and choices of catch cap,
but use the same type of monitoring data and assessment model
[e.g., @cleary2018].
The current stock assessment model assumes natural mortality is
time-varying and this is reflected in the MSE as
three hypotheses about future Pacific Herring natural mortality $M$: 

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-dependent process (DDM),

1. $M$ is a time-varying, density-independent process (DIM), and

1. $M$ is constant over time (conM).

These three hypotheses are captured as
three operating model (OM) scenarios in @benson2022.
The DDM scenario was identified as the reference OM scenario based on
discussion at the 2018 CSAS review process [@dfo2019c],
while the DIM and conM scenarios were identified as robustness OM scenarios.
In 2022 we removed the conM scenario from the list of
plausible natural mortality hypotheses because
MP performance has been found to be consistently over-optimistic.
As such, OM updates are presented for the DDM and DIM OM scenarios only.

Several lessons were learned from the MSE analyses conducted so far:

1. The catch-at-age stock assessment model can produce large (positive)
assessment errors and in such cases, assessment errors can cause 
over-estimation of the spawning biomass.
However Herring OMs simulate these phenomena and thus assessment errors
are accounted for in the MP evaluations.

1. Reduction in harvest rate from 20% to 10% was the most effective means of
mitigating stock assessment errors by
reducing the absolute size of the catch.
The use of a catch cap, implemented as a maximum annual catch level, 
is an effective model-free way to
further mitigate assessment errors at very high biomass levels.
Simulation analyses additionally showed that outcomes
are insensitive to the choice of operational control points (OCPs)
in the HCR when a low harvest rate (HR) and catch cap are applied.
This occurs because low biomass levels (associated with the lower OCP)
are avoided for these MPs.

1. Differences in specification of Pacific Herring MPs,
including HCR components, are expected a priori among SARs.
The reasons relate to
differences in objectives deemed important by resource users,
differences in historical and current stock and fishery dynamics, and
differences in the magnitude and direction
of assessment model errors in each SAR.
Conservation objectives such as those based on avoiding a biological limit
reference point (LRP) in alignment with the DFO PA Policy [@dfo2009] are held 
constant among SARs based on the analyses of @kronlund2017.

1. There are many possible ways to incorporate MP performance in
robustness trials into decision-making but, 
there is currently no accepted scientific way of
combining results from multiple operating models.

1. In situations where multiple MPs meet the agreed upon objectives,
further criteria, such as ranking secondary objectives, is needed in order to
provide decision-makers with a tractable set of trade-off choices.

1. Outcomes of MP evaluations appear to be more heavily influenced by
the last three to five years of stock status and 
natural mortality trends used to condition the OM. 
If simulations were run over a greater number of years (e.g., 50 years)
performance would start to approach equilibrium and be 
unaffected by most recent trends in OM conditioning data.
This phenomenon is important to consider when selecting or eliminating MPs, 
especially if probabilities are considerably different between MP updates.

## Input data

There are three types of input data used for
the Pacific Herring stock assessment:
catch data, biological data, and abundance data.
These data are described in the following sections, and
summarized in Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Relative to the previous assessment,
the only change to input data was to extend all the time series
to include the `r this_season` herring season (July 1 to June 30).
Note that we refer to 'year' instead of 'herring season' in this report;
therefore `r assess_yr` refers to the `r this_season` Pacific Herring season.

### Catch data

For the purposes of stock assessment,
catch data are summarized by gear type as described in
Table \@ref(tab:data-input) and presented in Figure \@ref(fig:major-catch).
As in previous years, catch data for the stock assessment model
does not include mortality from the commercial SOK fishery,
nor any recreational fisheries or food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) harvest.
Recreational fisheries and FSC harvest are considered minor
relative to commercial harvest.
The commercial SOK fishery is licensed based on pounds of validated SOK product
(i.e., eggs adhered to kelp), not tonnes of fish used or spawned.
Currently there is no basis to validate mortality
imposed on the population by this fishery, however
methods for estimating SOK mortality are being developed.

Combined commercial removals from `r assess_yr - num_yrs_tab` to `r assess_yr`
from the roe, food and bait, and special use fisheries
appear in Table \@ref(tab:annual-catch).
The proportion of coast-wide catch that comes from SoG was
22% in 1990, and 100% in `r assess_yr`.
Total SOK harvest (i.e., pounds of validated product) for the major SARs
from `r assess_yr - num_yrs_tab` to `r assess_yr` is presented in
Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch).

### Biological data\label{sec:biol-data}

Biological samples are collected as described in
@cleary2018 and Table \@ref(tab:data-input).
Biological data inputs to the stock assessment are
annual weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-wa)) and 
annual number-at-age, shown as proportion-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-pa)).

Significant declines in weight-at-age are evident for all major herring stocks
from the mid-1980s to 2010.
Declining weight-at-age may be due to a number of factors, including
fishing effects (i.e., gear selectivity),
environmental effects (e.g., changes in ocean productivity), or
changes in sampling protocols
(e.g., shorter time frame over which samples are collected).
Declines in weight-at-age appear to have ceased since 2010.

### Abundance data

The spawn index survey collects information on
spawn length (i.e., distance parallel to shore),
spawn width (i.e., distance perpendicular to shore),
number of egg layers by vegetation type, and
other data.
There are two spawn survey periods defined by the predominant survey method:
surface survey period from `r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`, and
dive survey period from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`.
Data from these surveys are used to calculate egg density in each spawn.
Ultimately, the estimated weight of mature spawners required
to produce the egg deposition is calculated and
referred to as the 'spawn index'.
The `r surv_yr_rng[2]` spawn survey followed standard dive survey protocols
for the HG, PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI SARs as described in @cleary2018.
Time series of spawn index by major stock assessment region (SAR)
from `r paste(surv_yr_rng, collapse=" to ")`
are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index).
In `r surv_yr_rng[2]`, there was an
increase in survey biomass (i.e., index values) for the PRD and SoG SARs, and
a decrease in survey biomass for HG, CC, and WCVI SARs
(Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index;
Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) to \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi)).

## Spatial spawn distribution

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) through \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) 
summarize the spatial distribution of survey spawn biomass
(i.e., the spawn index)
by proportion over the last `r num_yrs_tab + 1` years for the major SARs.
HG and SoG are summarized by Group, while
PRD, CC, and WCVI are summarized by Statistical Area;
the choice of spatial grouping reflects spawning behaviour and
biology for each SAR based on the
survey data and working group discussions with local First Nations.

## Incidental mortality

In order to advance progress towards
a holistic ecosystem-based management (EBM) approach for Pacific Herring,
we present information to describe indirect effects on herring populations
such as incidental mortality. 
Some fisheries and aquaculture activities in BC cause
incidental mortality to Pacific Herring.
Similar to SOK harvest as well as FSC and recreational catch,
incidental mortality is currently only indirectly accounted for 
in Pacific Herring stock assessment by
estimating annual rates of natural mortality, 
and is considered minor relative to commercial harvest.

Again this year,
we include data for incidental mortality in finfish aquaculture activities
by SAR from `r min(ic_yrs)` to `r max(ic_yrs)`
(Figure \@ref(fig:major-incidental)).
Note that incidental mortality data are reported by
Pacific Fishery Management Area (PFMA)
which are analogous to Statistical Areas, but
PFMAs are larger and can extend beyond SAR boundaries.
Data indicate the number of Pacific Herring dead and released,
with the following caveats:

1. Data for `r max(ic_yrs)` are considered incomplete,

1. Unknown mortality rate for "released" fish,

1. Unknown length, weight, age, and sex of fish, and

1. "Herring-like" fish are assumed to be herring
when decomposition hinders identification.

Note that we sometimes update data in previous years
as DFO receives additional reports.

## First Nations observations

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact First Nations participation
in Pacific Herring survey activities as well as participation
in traditional harvest activities such as FSC.
In `r assess_yr`, local observations were provided by
coastal First Nations participants for most areas.
The following descriptions were provided by First Nations contributors.

### Haida Gwaii

The Selwyn Inlet stock has been showing a declining trend
for at least the past 10 years.
In 2021 the spawn occurred very late in the season (late April),
was located in outer Selwyn near Rockfish Harbour, and
was very light in deposition.
The spawn in 2022 was considered to be more consistent
in timing (mid April) and location (inside Selwyn near Traynor Bay), and
deposition was better than in 2021, but
the herring spawn was still very minimal for Selwyn Inlet standards. 

This year in the Skincuttle and Upper Burnaby area,
most spawning occurred on the Skincuttle side and
on the east side of Burnaby Island out near Scudder Point.
This stock is just barely maintaining itself.
Abundance is low enough that natural recruitment
just barely makes up for natural mortality,
so we see some years of slight recovery followed by other years of decline,
but no real growth even in the absence of a fishery for almost 20 years.
Spawns in 2022 were found to be mostly light to medium in deposition. 

The Juan Perez Sound inlets normally supports spawns
when there are a lot of recruits in the population
and first time spawners can out number older repeat spawners.
That has not been the case now for some time.
Lately spawns have been small and infrequent
in the inlets of Juan Perez Sound, as was the case in 2022.

There has not been a significant presence of herring
in outer Louscoone for a number of years.
In years of abundance, the local stock
was always found to be well up inside the inlet and
often presented a very light spawn near the head
early in the season (early to mid March).
This stock seldom exceeded 500 tons,
however in recent years it has been much less.
Other stocks, found in the outer portions of Louscoone Inlet,
are thought to be more migratory and rarely spawn in Louscoone. 

There was some effort for the traditional harvest of k’aaw
in both Skincuttle Inlet and Selwyn Inlet in early to mid April.
There were a few open kelp lines set up in Skincuttle Inlet
from which only about 1,000 lb of marginal to good quality k’aaw was harvested.
There were open kelp lines set up in the cove
just south of Traynor Bay, Selwyn Inlet,
but were reported to be unsuccessful due to disturbances by whales in the area.
There were no other known attempts to harvest k’aaw
on Haida Gwaii during the 2022 herring season.

### Prince Rupert District

Observations for PRD had not been provided
at the time the draft was submitted.

### Central Coast

<!-- TODO: JC to review the Heiltsuk observations -->

Heiltsuk herring observations for 2022:
This herring season spawning behavior was similar to last year
where herring spawned sporadically throughout the areas and
in different areas than in previous years.
This trend seems to be driven by whales, sea lions and seal populations,
and water temperature.
Younger and smaller age classes spawn in
the normal shallower water of 0 to 5 or 10 fathoms,
while the older and larger age classes now spawn deeper in 10 to 15 fathoms.
The deeper spawn was harder to locate and set kelp and boughs on. 
The shallower herring spawns lasted a day and a half,
and yielded minimal spawn for the spawn on kelp fishery.
Predation of whales, seals and sea lions has continued to
disrupt and move the spawning herring around
causing the deeper water spawns and shifting locations. 
Water temperature is suspected to influence herring spawning behavior
as well as predation.
Water temperatures this year and last year have been colder than normal;
local fishers identified this as the primary driver for
the changing spawning behavior with predation as the second.  

Sounding vessels and test boat skippers reported
adequate tonnage in areas with estimates of 32,000t to 36,000t
for the CC and shared that this was the low end of their estimate.   
 
Heiltsuk fishers, sounding vessels captains and HIRMD staff observed
that the dive survey vessels were late this year and cause for concern.
For example, the spawn that took place in Spiller
was not surveyed until 12 days afterwards.
This delayed survey would have missed
the greater portion of surviving spawn after predation.
Concerns raised that the overall Central Coast spawn survey
may not yield adequate data that reflects the actual biomass. 

FSC harvesters in Area 08 observed only brief spot spawns
lasting 24 hours or less.
Field observation confirmed egg thickness on kelp and branches
was limited to one layer for the most part.
Herring observed in spawning aggregations were small in size.

### Strait of Georgia

In the northern SoG in 2022,
spawn observations and ancillary information
regarding herring spawning activity was very limited
within the Discovery Islands.
One spawn was reported and a dive assessment was conducted on this spawn.
Generally a second or third spawn occurs in Bute Inlet;
however, no observations were made or reported this year.
which doesn’t indicate it didn’t happen.
Bute Inlet is very remote.
No other indications of spawn activity were observed or reported.

<!-- TODO: JC to review Cowichan Tribes observations -->

In the southern SoG, the Cowichan Tribes
did not actively observe herring spawn but some signs were seen.
For example, a huge mass/frenzy of birds were observed
in Active Pass on March 4th.

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The distribution of herring spawn activity in Barkley Sound
was similar to last year,
but the duration was shorter and the intensity was less this year.
Compared to last year, herring spawn activity in Nootka and Clayoquot Sounds
was greater in both distribution and intensity,
with a spawn lasting several days in Hesquiaht Harbour.
In Nootka, herring spawn was sighted
at Port Langford on February 24,
at Nuchatlitz and Rosa Harbour on March 3,
Yuquot and Santa Gertrudis Cove on March 10,
Catala Island on March 13, and
outer Bajo Reef on March 15.
Most trees set in the Nuchatlaht and Yuquot areas for SOB collection
were successful.

Area 24 had the largest spawning event
(in terms of distribution and intensity) in over 20 years.
A January spawn in a Hesquiaht Harbour was observed,
followed by a multi-day spawn in Hesquiaht Harbour from February 24 to March 7.
Spawning events were observed again in Hesquiaht Harbour later in March and
around Vargas, Stubbs, Mears (Opisaht) islands.
The herring spawn was described as moderate to heavy in most areas.

In Area 23, spawns were small and short in duration around mid-March.
The main spawn was around
Muscle Beach/Cabbage Rocks to Macoha on March 9 and
a spot spawn around Spilling islets on March 10.
Most trees set for SOB collections were bare or had one to two layers
and so were returned to the water to hatch.
A short duration spawn was observed around
Mayne Bay, Lyall Point, Pinkerton Islands, St Ines,
Stopper Islands, and Toquart Bay on March 27 to 29,
but no trees were set as most people had left the area for the season.

## Stock status update

Analyses of stock trend information is presented following
methods of @cleary2018 for the Pacific Herring major SARs (AM2 only).
As in previous years,
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs have chain length `r f(mcmc_length)`
with a sample taken every `r f(mcmc_samp_freq)`^th^ iteration (i.e., thinning).
The first `r f(mcmc_burnin)` samples are discarded (i.e., burn-in),
leaving `r f(mcmc_num_samples)` samples for posteriors.
Perceptions of stock status based on outputs (i.e., posteriors)
from the SCA model (i.e., AM2)
are summarized for each stock in a multi-panel figure
(e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)).
The panels show:

a. Model fit to scaled spawn survey data,

a. Instantaneous natural mortality rate $M$ estimates,

a. Number of age-`r age_first` recruits,

a. Spawning biomass $\SB_t$ and total catch $C_t$,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$,

a. Recruitment deviations (log scale) from the
Beverton-Holt recruitment function, and

a. Spawning biomass production $P_t = \SB_{t+1} - \SB_t + C_{t+1}$
for the dive survey period,
with reference lines at model estimates of $0.3\SB_0$.

Note that spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index) is scaled to abundance
in panel (a) by the spawn survey scaling parameter $q$.
The spawn index has two distinct periods defined by the dominant survey method: 
surface surveys (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`), and 
dive surveys (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`).
Thus, two $q$ parameters are implemented in the estimation procedure:
$q_1$ (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`)
with an uninformative prior, and
$q_2$ (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`)
with an informative prior approximating 1.0.

The surface survey methodology has been used on occasion
from `r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`. 
Generally this occurs when herring spawn is observed in locations where
a dive survey team is not available, or
when spawning occurs very early (e.g., January or February) or
late (e.g., May) in the season. 
In these instances,
spawning biomass estimates obtained from surface surveys for
a given SAR and year are added to biomass estimates from dive surveys,
and $q_2 = 1$ is assumed for the combined index.
The \link{https://github.com/grinnellm/Reports}{Pacific Herring data summaries}
show the proportion of spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index)
from the surface and dive survey methods by SAR and year.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only surface surveys were conducted
for HG in 2020 and 2021, as well as for PRD in 2020.
These surface survey observations are treated as dive survey observations and
are assumed to be continuous with the dive survey time series.

### Reference points\label{sec:ref-pts}

A biological limit reference point (LRP) is defined for the major
Pacific Herring SARs at $0.3\SB_0$ [@kronlund2017].
Candidate upper stock reference (USR) points were introduced in @cleary2018 and
implemented as biomass objectives in simulation analyses
for WCVI and SoG in 2018 [@dfo2019a] and 
for HG, PRD, and CC in 2019 [@dfo2019c].
An analysis of USR options was undertaken in 2022 with
results presented in @dfo2022.
Five USR options were evaluated:

1. Average spawning biomass during a productive period,
$\SB_{\mli{productive-period}}$ ($B_\text{MSY}$ proxy),

1. $0.4\SB_0$,

1. $0.5\SB_0$,

1. $0.6\SB_0$, and

1. Average spawning biomass from `r major_start_yr` to `r assess_yr`,
$\SB_{\mli{long-term}}$.

Implementing USRs as target biomass objectives within
the simulation-evaluation process allows the evaluation of
MPs with respect to achieving USRs, 
including whether a given USR option can be achieved in the absence of 
commercial fisheries. 
Implementation of USRs for major Herring SARs will occur through the 
2022/23 draft IFMP.

Stock status relative to assessment model estimates $0.3\SB_0$ (i.e., LRP) and
USR options are presented for PRD, CC, SoG, and WCVI SARs
(Tables \@ref(tab:ref-points-prd) through \@ref(tab:ref-points-wcvi)).

LRPs and USRs relate stock status to the DFO PA Policy [@dfo2009], and
the same calculations are used for each Pacific Herring SAR.
There is an important distinction between reference points (e.g., LRP, USR) and
operational control points (OCPs) of the harvest control rule (HCR)
or the management procedure (MP) used to set catch limits.
Specifically, OCPs define the inflection points of a HCR and
identify biomass levels where management action is taken,
whereas LRPs and USRs are management objectives.

### Coast wide trends

Coast wide trends in Pacific Herring biomass and contribution by SAR show 
an increasing trend in estimated spawning biomass from 2010 to 2020 with
low catch variability (Figure \@ref(fig:coastwide-biomass-catch)).
We also include total estimated biomass and spawning biomass for 
each SAR (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-total-biomass));
these trends are presented using median posterior estimates.

### Haida Gwaii

Estimated spawning biomass historic lows occurred in the late 1960s predicated
by estimated low recruitment and high estimated natural mortality 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)a, b, e). 
Under variable estimated recruitment, estimated spawning biomass recovered
from that point through the early 1980s supported by 
declining rates of estimated natural mortality.
As the estimated natural mortality again began increasing,
estimated biomass reached near historic lows in the mid-1990s. 
A reprieve in estimated low biomass was caused by 
above average estimated recruitment through the late 1990s,
before biomass declined to persistent at historic lows 
from 2000 to 2010 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)d).
Above average estimated recruitment of age-`r age_first` fish in 2012 supported 
modest increases in the spawn index in 2013 and 2015
before falling once again to near historic lows from 2016 to 2018
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)a, c, d).
The increasing trend in the estimated natural mortality rate since 1980
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)b) largely absorbed surplus production
attributed to above average recruitment events
(e.g., 1997 and 2012; Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)c, d).
Estimated natural mortality has declined from a peak around 2002,
and has decreased in the last five years. 
Despite the decline in estimated natural mortality, 
the HG stock has been in a low biomass state,
with many years also showing low productivity
which has largely precluded stock growth (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)f).
There is an increase in survey biomass in 2019 and 2020, and
above-average recruitment of age-`r age_first` fish in 2018, and
below-average recruitment in 2019, 2020, and 2022.
Estimated productivity in 2021/2022 is positive
but follows two years of negative productivity.
Overall, biomass remains low relative to historic values.
The effective harvest rate $U_t$ since 2000 has been at or near zero
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)),
with the last commercial roe fishery in 2002,
and the last commercial SOK fishery in 2004.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "HG", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`
Management measures to support long-term recovery of herring stocks in
Haida Gwaii are being developed through
the rebuilding plan process.$^{\ref{fn:rebuild}}$

### Prince Rupert District

Estimated spawning biomass reached historic highs in the early 1960s 
due to low estimated mortality rate and high estimated recruitment
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)a, b, e). 
This was followed immediately by below average recruitment and
a rise to the highest estimated mortality rate,
more than doubling within 10 years.
In response the stock collapsed to
the lowest estimated spawning biomass. 
Spawning biomass recovered by the mid-1980s to about 50% of the historic high
even amid mostly below-average recruitment
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)b, d, e).
In the mid-1980s, estimated spawning biomass steadily declined amid slowly 
rising mortality rates and variable recruitment, before stabilizing at a 
relatively low level (but above historic lows) by around 2005, 
which was maintained until 2018.
The estimated spawning biomass has since shown modest increases in biomass 
with above average age-`r age_first` recruitment in 2014, 2017, and 2018, and 
declining natural mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)c, d, f). 
Productivity in recent years is relatively high compared to the 
last 30 years (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)f).

Fluctuations in spawning biomass appear to be less than in other SARs,
possibly because some spawn index points are being under- or over-fit
(e.g., 2001 to 2004, and 2010 to 2013) as shown in 
Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)a.

`r stock_status_text(SAR = "PRD", this_yr = assess_yr, translate = french)`
Commercial fisheries have occurred annually in PRD since the mid-1980s,
with the exception of 2019 to 2022,
during which the effective harvest rate $U_t$ was estimated to be
at or below 20% in all years except 1989 (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
Commercial catches from 2007 to 2018 remained low (below 2,000&nbsp;t) and
there were no commercial catches from 2019 to 2022, except SOK.

### Central Coast

Estimated spawning biomass reached a historic high around 1980
following low estimated natural mortality rates and one of the highest estimated 
recruitments in 1979 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a, b, c). 
From there a decline in estimated spawning biomass
appears to be influenced initially by 
higher estimated natural mortality rates and
highly variable estimated recruitment.
An increase in estimated natural mortality lead to
historically low estimated biomass levels from 2005 to 2015. 
Decreasing estimated natural mortality lead to moderate increases in 
biomass through 2020. 
In 2021 and 2022,
increasing estimated natural mortality caused a decrease in estimated biomass,
which has been mitigated in part by higher than average 
estimated recruitment (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a, b, e).
Model estimates suggest similar spawning biomass in 2021 and 2022
(Table \@ref(tab:cc-spawning-biomass-depletion)),
and the analysis of surplus production shows evidence of
strong production in 2016/2017 and 2018/2019,
similar to the 1990 to 1999 period (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)f).
However, surplus production is estimated to be negative
in from 2019 to 2021 and near zero for 2021/2022.

An examination of spawn biomass by herring Section shows
the recent decline in herring spawn to have largely occurred in
Spiller Channel (Sections 072 and 078) and
Kitasu Bay/East Higgins (Section 067; Figure \@ref(fig:spawn-section-cc)).
The majority of Area 07 spawn in 2021 and 2022 is concentrated in
Thompson/Stryker (Section 074).
Occurrence of spawn in Thompson/Stryker from 2020 to 2022
represents the first significant spawns in this Section in many years.
The mechanisms driving spawn fluctuations in the Central Coast
are not well understood.

A fixed cutoff HCR was implemented in 1986, and
from 1986 to 2007 the effective harvest rate $U_t$ is estimated to fluctuate
above and below the `r target_hr*100`% target rate,
with median estimates exceeding `r target_hr*100`% in some of these years
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
Occurrences of $U_t$ exceeding the `r target_hr*100`% target harvest rate
are due in part to positive assessment model errors, and
lags in detecting a directional change in the trend.

Following a commercial fishery closure from 2007 to 2013,
the CC SAR was reopened to commercial fisheries;
commercial roe fisheries occurred in 2014, 2015, and 2016.
Commercial SOK fisheries operated yearly from 2014 to 2019, and in 2021.
SOK removals are not included in the estimation of $U_t$. 
A commercial SOK fishery did not occur in Area 07 in 2020 due to COVID-19,
and was not permitted in 2022 (Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch)).

### Strait of Georgia

The estimated spawning biomass for the SoG SAR
had a historical low in the late 1960's,
driven by lower than average estimated recruitment and
increasing estimated natural mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)a, b, e).
Following this, estimated spawning biomass increased
as natural mortality declined (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)b, d).
Some declines in estimated biomass in the mid 1980's and around 2008 were 
mitigated by above-average recruitment. 
From 2010 to 2020 there is an increasing trend in estimated spawning 
biomass caused by above-average estimated recruitment 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)b, d, e).

From 2015 to `r assess_yr` estimated natural mortality has been increasing,
after a previously long stable period from 1980 to 2010. 
Biomass declines due to increasing mortality have been mitigated by
above-average estimated recruitment in most years from 2010 to `r assess_yr`,
with estimated recruitment at an all time high in 2022
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)e). 
Estimated production was high in 2017/2018 and
then declined in the last three years (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)f).
In 2022 estimated spawning biomass was similar to 2021, and
was above the forecast.

The uncertainty associated with the last few years of spawning biomass
along with the forecast biomass `r paste0("$\\SB_{", assess_yr, "}$")`,
is quite large (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)d).
The large uncertainty in both spawning biomass and natural mortality estimates
in `r assess_yr` may be in part a function of large opposing fluctuations
in the spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)a) and
uncertainty in estimated age-`r age_first` recruitment.
The large uncertainty around estimated age-`r age_first` recruitment
in 2019 and 2020 was observed in the previous years' assessment and
remains apparent now that these age-`r age_first` fish are
fully recruited to the fishery and sampling gear.
Analysis of surplus production shows that the SoG SAR
was in high biomass state with neutral production in 2019/2020,
and that production was negative for 2021/2022
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-sog)f).

Commercial fisheries have occurred annually in SoG since the early-1970s
(following the stock collapse of the late 1960s).
Since implementing the fixed cutoff HCR in 1986,
the effective harvest rate $U_t$ is estimated to fluctuate
above and below the `r target_hr*100`% target rate,
with median estimates distributed evenly above and below `r target_hr*100`%
(Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
The model estimates the median effective harvest rate exceeded 25%
in 2006 and 2017.

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The time series of estimated spawning biomass reached an estimated peak in the 
mid to late 1970s during a time period of the
lowest estimated natural mortality and variable estimated recruitment
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a, b, c). 
From the late 1980s through to around 2008
a variable increase in estimated mortality and
a generally variable but low recruitment led to decline trend,
down from the peaks observed in the late 1970s 
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a, b, c).

The low estimated spawning biomass persisted from 2006 to 2012, 
influenced by negative recruitment deviations 
(i.e., lower than predicted by the stock-recruit function)
and the highest estimated natural mortality rates since `r major_start_yr`
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a, b, f). 
Some increases in estimated biomass were made in the 2010s with
lower estimated natural mortality and higher estimated recruitment in 2015. 
Since then estimated natural mortality has again increased. 
Biomass and production has been maintained in part by
higher than average estimated recruitment in 2020 and 2021
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi) d, f).
The model reconstruction of spawning biomass closely follows the trajectory
of spawn index values (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)a).

The absence of a commercial fishery since 2005 means the realized harvest rate
has been zero for the last 15 years (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)).
There is modest evidence for an increase in biomass above the LRP since 2016 and
positive production estimates in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-wcvi)f).

Investigation of WCVI MCMC diagnostics revealed autocorrelation
in the estimation of fishery selectivity-at-50% ($\hat{a}_1$) 
and its standard deviation ($\hat{\gamma}_1$)
for the "other" fisheries category
(i.e., reduction, food and bait, as well as special use).
Autocorrelation in parameter estimation may indicate
bias in the posterior distribution or local minima. 
In this instance, autocorrelation likely resulting from
there being no new commercial fishery data since 2005. 
Running longer chains in 2021 resulted in only minor improvements [@dfo2021c].
If and when fisheries resume in the future,
the addition of new fishery data may reduce this apparent autocorrelation and
any resulting bias.

## Management performance

Management procedure performance can be investigated using
the time series of effective harvest rate $U$.
Estimated effective harvest rate $U$ in each year $t$ is
$U_t = C_t/(C_t + \SB_t)$, where
$C_t$ is catch in year $t$, and
$\SB_t$ is estimated spawning biomass in year $t$.
Time series of $U_t$ relative to
the target harvest rate of `r target_hr*100`%
are presented in Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate).

## Application of MPs and harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`\label{sec:harv-opts}

Harvest options for `r assess_yr+1` reflect application of simulation-tested MPs
for each major SAR, derived from the Herring OM [@benson2022]. 
OM conditioning was updated using the latest historic stock and fishery data
from `r major_start_yr` to 2021.
MPs are not provided for HG because
this is now conducted within the rebuilding plan process.

### Haida Gwaii

The HG stock persisted in a low biomass state
from approximately 2000 to 2018
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)).
The stock was below the LRP for much of that period and shows
little evidence of sustained stock growth despite the absence of
commercial fisheries since 2002 (and since 2004 for the SOK fishery).
Survey biomass increased from 2019 to 2020,
remained stable in 2021,
and declined from 2021 to 2022.
Spawn biomass production was positive in 2021.
Results of the simulation-evaluations found that none of the proposed MPs, 
including the historical and no fishing MPs,
maintained spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability
[i.e., at least 75%, @dfo2009].\footnote{\label{fn:HighProb}``High'' probability
is defined as 75 to 95\% by the DFO decision-making framework (DFO 2009).}

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "HG", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

DFO has committed to developing and implementing a rebuilding plan for
Haida Gwaii Pacific Herring.
Work finalizing the draft for consultation continues via a 
technical working group comprised of members of
the Council of Haida Nation, DFO, and Parks Canada.
The consultation period is anticipated to commence in fall 2022.
Guidance for developing rebuilding plans [@dfo2013] states that
the primary objective of any rebuilding plan is to
promote stock growth out of the Critical Zone
(i.e., to grow the stock above the status-based LRP) by
ensuring removals from all fishing sources are kept to the lowest possible level
until the stock has cleared this zone with high probability.
However, stock rebuilding does not end having met this goal, and
one of the goals of the rebuilding plan will be to
identify candidate threshold biomass levels greater than the LRP
that are consistent with a rebuilt state.

Based on MP evaluations and the ongoing rebuilding plan process,
the harvest recommendation for the HG stock in `r assess_yr + 1` is 0&nbsp;t.
Because Haida Gwaii has an on-going rebuilding plan process,
we did not update HG MP evaluations with recent data.

### Prince Rupert District

The PRD estimated stock biomass showed little trend from 2005 to 2018, 
fluctuating at or near the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$
(Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)d). 
Spawning biomass increased above $0.3\SB_0$ in 2019 and has
remained above since.
Adjacent SARs (i.e., HG and CC)
show evidence of recent prolonged periods of low biomass and low productivity;
however these states were entered rapidly and were preceded by
high biomass levels [@kronlund2017].

In the summer of 2022, we updated the conditioning of the OM
for PRD with 2021 spawn, catch, and biological data.
We re-ran MSE simulations to generate updated probability values for MPs
presented in 2019 [@dfo2020a] and 2020 [@dfo2021].
These latest MP evaluations also appear in @dfo2022.
No new MPs were included,
however probability metrics for the five USRs options [@dfo2022]
were estimated and have been added to the harvest options tables.
<!-- TODO-: Make %'s auto update.JC: Defer until after SR is submitted-->
Updated closed-loop feedback simulations for PRD show that
MPs with harvest rates at 5, 10, and 20% maintain spawning biomass
above the LRP with 85 to 98% probability, over both OM scenarios
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd)). 
`r mean_harvest_text(SAR = "PRD", translate = french)`

While MPs with harvest rates ranging from 5% to 20%
were able to meet the core conservation objective of
maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with high probability
(i.e., at least 75%)^\ref{fn:HighProb}^,
they also imply different trade-offs among biomass and yield objectives.
Since multiple MPs meet the conservation objective,
other socio-economic reasons may drive the choice for a particular MP.

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "PRD", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd)
and include probability values that reflect updated OM conditioning.
Options reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1`
forecast biomass for PRD,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective with a minimum 75% probability
under both DDM and DIM OM scenarios.
For ease of comparison with MP performance evaluation, harvest options are 
presented along side MP performance metrics for both OM scenarios 
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-prd)).

### Central Coast

The CC stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from
approximately 2005 to 2014.
In years since, an increasing trend has been observed in all but the 
most recent two years (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a).

In the summer of 2022, we updated the conditioning of the MSE operating model
for CC with 2021 spawn, catch, and biological data.
These latest MP evaluations also appear in @dfo2022.
No new MPs were included however probability metrics for the five USRs options 
[@dfo2022] were estimated and have been added to the harvest options tables.
<!-- TODO-: Make %'s auto update.JC: Defer until after SR is submitted-->
The updated simulations show that MPs with harvest rates at 5% and 10% 
maintain spawning biomass above the LRP with 81 to 92% probability over all 
both OM scenarios (Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc)).
`r mean_harvest_text(SAR = "CC", translate = french)`

Harvest options listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-cc) reflect
application of MPs to the 2023 forecast biomass for CC,
whereby each MP meets the conservation objective
with a minimum 75% probability under both DDM or DIM OM scenarios.

Since multiple MPs meet the conservation objective of
maintaining spawning biomass above the LRP with at least 75%,
other socio-economic objectives may drive the choice for a particular MP. 
Additionally, the current CC OM is unable to directly address
Heilstuk Nation conservation objectives related to herring age and size, nor 
objectives on a finer spatial scale or those specific to SOK fisheries.
These limitations exist for all five major stocks.

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "CC", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

<!-- TODO: Review this statement with senior management (Neil/Andy) -->
Finally, DFO acknowledges commitment to the Heiltsuk Nation for
the development of a Joint Fisheries Management Plan for Pacific Herring
in the Central Coast in `r assess_yr + 1`.
Results presented here may inform this on going commitment.

### Strait of Georgia

The SoG has the largest biomass of the major SARs
and comprises more than 50% of the total coast wide biomass 
(Figure \@ref(fig:coastwide-biomass-catch)).
Estimated spawning biomass trends remained stable and high from
2011 through 2020, though increases in estimated natural mortality rates
have increased in the last three to five years.
SoG MP evaluations are implemented using the Herring OM [@benson2022] and
were first presented in 2018 [@dfo2019a].
MP updates were conducted in 2020 [@dfo2021b] and again herein.
Each update shows differences in MP performance against
the conservation objective for both OM scenarios.
Initial simulations show the probability of meeting the conservation 
objective ranges from 91% to 100% [@dfo2019a], depending on the scenario and MP.
Subsequent updates in 2020 show a decline in conservation performance with
probabilities ranging from 75% to 88% (DDM and DIM only, @dfo2021b), and the
updates included here show probabilities ranging from 67% to 87%
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-sog)).

These comparisons highlights the importance of considering
the lessons learned from the MSE process (Section "\nameref{sec:mse}")
when selecting or rejecting MPs.
In this case it may be important to consider how the recent MP updates 
may be influenced by the the last three to five years
of natural mortality trends used to condition the OM
(Table \@ref(tab:decision-sog)). 

MSE updates presented here show the conservation objective is met with the
minimum 75% probability when simulating MPs with 10% and 15% harvest rates.
However MPs with 20% harvest rates 
(e.g., HS30-60_HR20 and minE30_HR20),
which previously met the minimum 75% probability level
(@dfo2019a and @dfo2021b) now show probability values ranging
from 67% to 74% (across both DDM and DIM OMs).

In situations where estimated natural mortality trends show
a sudden increasing or decreasing trend in the terminal three to five years,
MP evaluations may more reliably reflect
the relative ranking of MP performance, as opposed to
realized short term performance.
In all cases the simulated MP performance from previous years can inform 
selection or elimination of MPs.

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "SoG", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

`r mean_harvest_text(SAR = "SoG", translate = french)`
Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs,
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-sog).
These options reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1`
forecast biomass for SoG,
whereby each MP meets (or has been shown to meet) the conservation objective 
with a minimum 75% probability.
All MPs and scenarios listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-sog) include
updated performance metrics under both scenarios [@dfo2021b].

### West Coast of Vancouver Island

The WCVI stock persisted in a low biomass, low productivity state from
approximately 2004 to 2014.
In recent years, biomass remained low relative to historic levels,
but above the LRP of $0.3\SB_0$.

In 2022, with updated 2021 data, closed-loop feedback simulations
for WCVI show the conservation objective is met
under the DDM OM scenario with between 80 and 84% probability,
and the same MPs failed to meet the conservation objective under the DIM 
OM scenario, where natural mortality rates are
most similar to the last 10 years ($p=$ 61 to 65%).

`r proj_biomass_text(SAR = "WCVI", next_yr = assess_yr + 1, translate = french)`

Harvest options for `r assess_yr + 1`, resulting from simulation-tested MPs,
are presented in Table \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi).
These options reflect application of MPs to the `r assess_yr + 1`
forecast biomass for WCVI, under the two OM scenarios.
All MPs and scenarios listed in Table \@ref(tab:decision-wcvi) include
updated performance metrics under both scenarios [@dfo2021b].
